**The Fundamental Theorem for Curls** 

The fundamental theorem for curls, which goes by the special name of Stokes' theorem, states that

$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \oint_P \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
$$

As always, the integral of a derivative (here, the curl) over a region (here, a patch of surface, $S$) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (here, the perimeter of the patch, $P$). 

As in the case of the divergence theorem, the boundary term is itself an integral—specifically, a closed line integral.

**Geometrical Interpretation**: 

Recall that the curl measures the "twist" of the vectors $\mathbf{v}$; a region of high curl is a whirlpool—if you put a tiny paddle wheel there, it will rotate. Now, the integral of the curl over some surface (or, more precisely, the flux of the curl through that surface) represents the "total amount of swirl," and we can determine that just as well by going around the edge and finding how much the flow is following the boundary (Fig. 1.31). Indeed, $\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$ is sometimes called the circulation of $\mathbf{v}$.

You may have noticed an apparent ambiguity in Stokes' theorem: concerning the boundary line integral, which way are we supposed to go around (clockwise or counterclockwise)? If we go the "wrong" way, we'll pick up an overall sign error. The answer is that it doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you are consistent, for there is a compensating sign ambiguity in the surface integral:  
Which way does $d\mathbf{a}$ point? For a closed surface (as in the divergence theorem), $d\mathbf{a}$ points in the direction of the outward normal; but for an open surface, which way is "out"? Consistency in Stokes' theorem (as in all such matters) is given by the right-hand rule: if your fingers point in the direction of the line integral, then your thumb fixes the direction of $d\mathbf{a}$ (Fig. 1.32).

Now, there are plenty of surfaces (infinitely many) that share any given boundary line. Twist a paper clip into a loop, and dip it in soapy water. The soap film constitutes a surface, with the wire loop as its boundary. If you blow on it, the soap film will expand, making a larger surface, with the same boundary. Ordinarily, a flux integral depends critically on what surface you integrate over, but evidently this is not the case with curls. 

For Stokes' theorem says that  

$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{a}
$$

is equal to the line integral of $\mathbf{v}$ around the boundary, and the latter makes no reference to the specific surface you choose.

**Corollary 1**: 

$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{a}
$$

depends only on the boundary line, not on the particular surface used.

**Corollary 2**:

$$
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 0
$$

for any closed surface, since the boundary line, like the mouth of a balloon, shrinks down to a point, and hence the right side of Eq. (1.57) vanishes.

These corollaries are analogous to those for the gradient theorem. We will develop the parallel further in due course.

### 向量微積分的基本脈絡（核心觀念）

> **對一個導函數（不論是一維導數、梯度、散度或旋度）在某個區域上做積分，其結果由原函數在邊界上的值所決定。**

這是一條貫穿整個向量微積分的主軸。

在本段文字中，有三個重點，第一，直觀解釋，水池中的水如果有旋度，樹葉或其他東西浮在水面上會旋轉

第二，路徑和面積方向的天然模糊性，取右手定則，可以互相補償掉

第三，面積分的面積無關性，類似梯度的路徑無關，這表示向量場的旋度場是一種特殊的場，它的面積分由邊界迴路所決定
