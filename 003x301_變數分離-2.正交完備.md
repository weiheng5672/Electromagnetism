- The success of this method hinged on two extraordinary properties of the separable solutions: 
  - completeness 
  - and orthogonality. 

- A set of functions $f_n(y)$ is said to be complete 
  - if any other function $f(y)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of them:
    $$
    f(y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n f_n(y).
    $$

- The functions $\sin(n \pi y / a)$ are complete on the interval $0 \leq y \leq a$. 
- It was this fact, guaranteed by Dirichlet’s theorem, that assured us 範例3-3 could be satisfied, given the proper choice of the coefficients $C_n$. 
- (The proof of completeness, for a particular set of functions, is an extremely difficult business, and I’m afraid physicists tend to assume it’s true and leave the checking to others.)

- A set of functions is orthogonal 
  - if the integral of the product of any two different members of the set is zero:
    $$
    \int_0^a f_n(y) f_{n'}(y) \, dy = 0 \quad \text{for } n' \neq n.
    $$

- The sine functions are orthogonal; 
  - this is the property on which Fourier’s trick is based, 
  - allowing us to kill off all terms but one in the infinite series 
  - and thereby solve for the coefficients $C_n$. 
- (Proof of orthogonality is generally quite simple, either by direct integration or by analysis of the differential equation from which the functions came.)

這段話主要在解釋 正交性（orthogonality） 和 完備性（completeness） 這兩個概念，這兩者對於可分離解（separable solutions）的方法至關重要，特別是在解偏微分方程時，例如在傅立葉級數展開中。
