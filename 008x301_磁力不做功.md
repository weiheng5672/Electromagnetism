這裡的回顧，仔細探討了一塊磁鐵把一塊鐵磁性物質吸起的時候，是誰在做功的問題

為了探討方便，對於被吸引的鐵磁性物質，作了雙重的假設，這個雙重假設，是作者探討脈絡的關鍵

一個鐵磁性物質在磁場中受到的影響是會被磁化，磁化會等效成表面電流密度以及體積電流密度，

這個時候是受到了磁場的影響，被磁化了，但還沒被吸上去的階段。

為了簡化，把在磁場中的鐵磁性物質，簡化成一個電流迴路，這是第一重假設

第二重假設是把電流迴路進一步簡化成，旋轉的均勻帶電絕緣環

在以上兩重假設之下，這個狀態，結論是，當圓環被吸引提升一個高度，位能增加，圓環的旋轉速度會變慢，

也就是說，圓環的位能增加，是來自自身動能的減少，磁力不做功，只是起到能量轉換的作用

它的核心在於，磁場確實影響了鐵磁性物質，使其磁化，但磁場本身並不直接對其做功，而是透過能量轉換的機制來解釋物體的上升。  

**雙重假設的關鍵作用**  
1. **將鐵磁性物質視為電流迴路**：這是基於磁化效應，因為磁化後的物體可以等效為具有表面電流密度與體積電流密度的結構。這一步簡化了問題，使其能夠用電流迴路的方式來分析受力情況。  
2. **進一步簡化為旋轉的帶電絕緣環**：這樣做的目的是更方便地分析能量轉換過程，特別是將上升的位能變化與旋轉動能變化建立直接關係。  

**結論**  
- 當這個旋轉的環被磁場吸引上升時，它的位能增加，而旋轉速度減慢。
- 這意味著，環的位能增量來自於自身動能的減少，而不是磁場直接做功，磁場的作用只是改變能量的形式。

**進一步思考**  
- 在現實情境中，這個理想化模型並不完全適用，特別是當磁鐵吸引另一塊磁鐵時，如何解釋能量來源就變得更複雜。例如，是否存在某種「磁力的極限」，即磁鐵吸引過多物體後磁力會減弱？  
- 磁化本身是否需要能量？這裡並未考慮磁化過程的能量來源，但顯然，外部必須提供某種能量來改變物體的磁狀態。  
- 這個分析的價值在於，它在一個局部範圍內清楚地展示了能量守恆與「磁力不做功」的原則，儘管現實情境可能更為複雜，但這種抽象化的思考對於理解磁場的本質非常有啟發性，這種思考方式很有理論物理的風格。

無論如何，在前述的討論中的永久磁體，似乎沒有消耗任何能量就將物體舉起來

永久磁鐵的這種特性，讓無數民科將永動機的幻想寄託在上面

儘管我們仔細探討了其中的機制，這個例子反倒正是能量守恆的範例，而不是在示範永動機

但這種錯覺仍舊相當的深刻，承載了無數人的幻想

以下將進一步進行討論，消除這種幻覺

我還沒仔細看，但粗略看過一下，大致上就是，在這個更現實的圖像中

大迴路和小迴路的電流都恆定

將小迴路舉起，需要大迴路做功

這就好比用電磁鐵吸引鐵磁性金屬的時候，做功的明顯是電源

在這個人工想像的圖像中，電源所需提供的能量，比舉起小迴路所需的重力位能增量還要多——額外的能量進入了電磁場。

但原文顯然說明了更多東西，有眾多公式也是要去做習題才能得到，文中直接利用結果

原文還有什麼其他重點?

What about the magnet? 

Is it completely passive in this process? 

Suppose we model it as a big circular loop (radius $b$), resting on a table and carrying a current $I_b$; the "junk car" is a relatively small current loop (radius $a$), on the floor directly below, carrying a current $I_a$ (Fig. 8.10). 

![Figure 8.10](Figs/FIGURE%208.10.png)

This time, just for a change, let’s assume both currents are constant (we’ll include a regulated power supply in each loop).  

Parallel currents attract, and we propose to lift the small loop off the floor, keeping careful track of the work done and the agency responsible.  

Let’s start by adjusting the currents so the small ring just "floats," a distance $h$ below the table, with the magnetic force exactly balancing the weight ($m_a g$) of the little ring. 

I’ll let you calculate the magnetic force (Prob. 8.11):  
$$
F_{\text{mag}} = \frac{3\pi}{2} \frac{\mu_0 I_a I_b a^2 b^2 h}{(b^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} = m_a g
$$

Now the loop rises an infinitesimal distance $dz$; the work done is equal to the gain in its potential energy:  
$$
dW_g = m_a g dz = \frac{3\pi}{2} \frac{\mu_0 I_a I_b a^2 b^2 h}{(b^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} dz
$$

Who did it? The magnetic field? No! 

The work was done by the power supply that sustains the current in loop $a$ (Ex. 5.3). 

As the loop rises, a motional emf is induced in it. 

The flux through the loop is  
$$
\Phi_a = M I_b
$$

where $M$ is the mutual inductance of the two loops:  

$$
M = \frac{\pi \mu_0}{2} \frac{a^2 b^2}{(b^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}
$$

(Prob. 7.22). The emf is  
$$
E_a = -\frac{d\Phi_a}{dt} = -I_b \frac{dM}{dt} = -I_b \frac{dM}{dh} \frac{dh}{dt}
$$

Since  
$$
\frac{dM}{dh} = -\frac{3}{2} \frac{\pi \mu_0}{2} \frac{a^2 b^2 2h}{(b^2 + h^2)^{5/2}}
$$

we get  
$$
E_a = I_b \left( \frac{3\pi}{2} \frac{\mu_0 a^2 b^2 h}{(b^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} \right) dz/dt
$$

The work done by the power supply (fighting against this motional emf) is  
$$
dW_a = -E_a I_a dt = \frac{3\pi}{2} \frac{\mu_0 I_a I_b a^2 b^2 h}{(b^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} dz
$$
— same as the work done in lifting the loop (Eq. 8.40).  

Meanwhile, however, a Faraday emf is induced in the upper loop due to the changing flux from the lower loop:  
$$
\Phi_b = M I_a \Rightarrow E_b = -I_a \frac{dM}{dt}
$$

The work done by the power supply in ring $b$ (to sustain the current $I_b$) is  
$$
dW_b = -E_b I_b dt = \frac{3\pi}{2} \frac{\mu_0 I_a I_b a^2 b^2 h}{(b^2 + h^2)^{5/2}} dz
$$
exactly the same as $dW_a$. 

That’s embarrassing—the power supplies have done twice as much work as was necessary to lift the junk car! 

Where did the "wasted" energy go?  

Answer: It increased the energy stored in the fields. 

The energy in a system of two current-carrying loops is (see Prob. 8.12)  
$$
U = \frac{1}{2} L_a I_a^2 + \frac{1}{2} L_b I_b^2 + M I_a I_b
$$

so  
$$
dU = I_a I_b \frac{dM}{dt} dt = dW_b
$$

Remarkably, all four energy increments are the same. 

If we care to apportion things this way, the power supply in loop $a$ contributes the energy necessary to lift the lower ring, while the power supply in loop $b$ provides the extra energy for the fields. 

If all we’re interested in is the work done to raise the ring, we can ignore the upper loop (and the energy in the fields) altogether.  

In both these models, the magnet itself was stationary. 

That’s like lifting a paper clip by holding a magnet over it. 

But in the case of the magnetic crane, the car stays in contact with the magnet, which is attached to a cable that lifts the whole works. 

As a model, we might stick the upper loop in a big box, the lower loop in a little box, and crank up the currents so the force of attraction is much greater than $m_a g$; the two boxes snap together, and we attach a string to the upper box and pull up on it (Fig. 8.11).  

The same old mechanism (Ex. 5.3) prevails: as the lower loop rises, the magnetic force tilts backwards; its vertical component lifts the loop, but its horizontal component opposes the current, and no net work is done. 

This time, however, the motional emf is perfectly balanced by the Faraday emf fighting to keep the current going—the flux through the lower loop is not changing. 

(If you like, the flux is increasing because the loop is moving upward, into a region of higher magnetic field, but it is decreasing because the magnetic field of the upper loop—at any given point in space—is decreasing as that loop moves up.) 

No power supply is needed to sustain the current (and for that matter, no power supply is required in the upper loop either, since the energy in the fields is not changing).  

Who did the work to lift the car? The person pulling up on the rope, obviously. The role of the magnetic field was merely to transmit this energy to the car via the vertical component of the magnetic force. But the magnetic field itself (as always) did no work.  

The fact that magnetic fields do no work follows directly from the Lorentz force law, so if you think you have discovered an exception, you’re going to have to explain why that law is incorrect. 

For example, if magnetic monopoles exist, the force on a particle with electric charge $q_e$ and magnetic charge $q_m$ becomes (Prob. 7.38):  

$$
F = q_e (E + v \times B) + q_m (B - \mu_0 v \times E).
$$

In that case, magnetic fields can do work... but only on magnetic charges. 

So unless your car is made of monopoles (I don’t think so), this doesn’t solve the problem.  

A somewhat less radical possibility is that in addition to electric charges, there exist permanent point magnetic dipoles (electrons?), whose dipole moment $m$ is not associated with any electric current, but simply *is*. 

The Lorentz force law acquires an extra term:  

$$
F = q (E + v \times B) + \nabla (m \cdot B).
$$

The magnetic field can do work on these "intrinsic" dipoles (which experience no motional or Faraday emf, since they enclose no flux). 

However, classical electrodynamics is predicated on Ampère’s assumption that all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion, and point magnetic dipoles must be interpreted as the limits of tiny current loops.
