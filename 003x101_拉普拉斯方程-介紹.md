### Introduction  

The primary task of electrostatics is to find the electric field of a given stationary charge distribution. In principle, this purpose is accomplished by Coulomb’s law, in the form of Eq. 2.8:  

$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \int \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} \rho(\mathbf{r}') d\tau'
$$

Unfortunately, integrals of this type can be difficult to calculate for any but the simplest charge configurations. Occasionally, we can get around this by exploiting symmetry and using Gauss’s law, but ordinarily, the best strategy is first to calculate the potential $V$, which is given by the somewhat more tractable Eq. 2.29:  

$$
V(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \int \frac{1}{r} \rho(\mathbf{r}') d\tau'
$$

Still, even this integral is often too tough to handle analytically. Moreover, in problems involving conductors, $\rho$ itself may not be known in advance; since charge is free to move around, the only thing we control directly is the total charge (or perhaps the potential) of each conductor.  

In such cases, it is fruitful to recast the problem in differential form, using Poisson’s equation (2.24),  

$$
\nabla^2 V = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \rho
$$

which, together with appropriate boundary conditions, is equivalent to Eq. 3.2.  

Very often, in fact, we are interested in finding the potential in a region where $\rho = 0$. (If $\rho = 0$ everywhere, of course, then $V = 0$, and there is nothing further to say—that’s not what I mean. There may be plenty of charge elsewhere, but we’re confining our attention to places where there is no charge.)  

In this case, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation:  

$$
\nabla^2 V = 0
$$

or, written out in Cartesian coordinates,  

$$
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial z^2} = 0.
$$

This formula is so fundamental to the subject that one might almost say electrostatics is the study of Laplace’s equation.  

At the same time, it is a ubiquitous equation, appearing in such diverse branches of physics as gravitation and magnetism, the theory of heat, and the study of soap bubbles. In mathematics, it plays a major role in analytic function theory.  

To get a feel for Laplace’s equation and its solutions (which are called harmonic functions), we shall begin with the one- and two-dimensional versions, which are easier to picture and illustrate all the essential properties of the three-dimensional case.

Griffiths 表示，拉普拉斯方程（Laplace's equation）幾乎無處不在。
這種普遍性來自於它的數學特性，與物理系統趨向最低能量狀態的性質高度相容。
這點與拉普拉斯方程本身的特性息息相關。

物理學家狄拉克（Dirac）曾說過：「真正理解一個方程式，應該是即使不去解它，也能看出它蘊含的物理與數學性質。」

拉普拉斯方程正是这样一种具有强烈物理直觉的数学模型。

拉普拉斯方程的一個關鍵特性是平均性質（Mean Value Property）：
方程解在任何一點的值，等於該點周圍某些特定點值的平均。

這個性質在二維和三維空間並不容易直觀看出，但在一維空間則顯而易見。
