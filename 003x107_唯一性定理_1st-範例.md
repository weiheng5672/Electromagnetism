**Example 3.1.** 

- Show that the potential is constant 
  - inside an enclosure completely surrounded by conducting material, 
  - provided there is no charge within the enclosure.

**Solution:** 

- The potential on the cavity wall is some constant, $V_0$ 
- so the potential inside is a function that satisfies Laplace’s equation 
  - and has the constant value $V_0$ at the boundary. 
  
- It doesn’t take a genius to think of one solution to this problem: 
  - $ V = V_0 $ everywhere. 

- The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this is the only solution. 
  - (It follows that the field inside an empty cavity is zero—
  - the same result we found in 靜電屏蔽 on rather different grounds.)

- The correct value on the boundaries, then it’s right. 
- You’ll see the power of this argument when we come to the method of images. 
- Incidentally, it is easy to improve on the first uniqueness theorem: 
  - I assumed there was no charge inside the region in question, 
  - so the potential obeyed Laplace’s equation, 
  - but we may as well throw in some charge (in which case $V$ obeys Poisson’s equation). 
  - The argument is the same, only this time:

$$
\nabla^2 V_1 = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho, \quad \nabla^2 V_2 = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho
$$

so

$$
\nabla^2 V_3 = \nabla^2 V_1 - \nabla^2 V_2 = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho + \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho = 0.
$$

- Once again, the difference $(V_3 \equiv V_1 - V_2)$ satisfies Laplace’s equation 
- and has the value zero on all boundaries, so $V_3 = 0$ and hence $V_1 = V_2$.

**Corollary:** 
- The potential in a volume $V$ is uniquely determined 
  - if (a) the charge density throughout the region, 
  - and (b) the value of $V$ on all boundaries, are specified.

唯一性定理的威力在於，
如果我能夠用任何方式猜到答案，
那他就是唯一的答案

這個習題，就是猜答案是個常數，
然後確認他既滿足拉普拉斯方程式，
又滿足邊界條件，所以他就是解，
再藉由靜電學唯一性定理，
他就是唯一解，真的就這樣而已，
後半部分只是在稍微推廣第一唯一性定理的適用範圍。

這個問題在靜電屏蔽，我們是透過反證法，
假設空腔有電場，推出違反靜電學性質的結果，
電場對封閉路徑積分不為零，矛盾，假設錯誤，
所以，空腔沒有電場。
