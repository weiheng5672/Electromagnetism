有了載流導線受的力，透過這個範例，可以認識到，磁力不做功，但磁力又能把東西抬起來，這個看似矛盾的現象是怎麼回事。

先說結論，磁力扮演著一種，改變力的作用方向的角色，這跟範例5-2的擺線是一樣的。課文舉了斜面的正向力作為類比，水平推動斜面上的重物，這時正向力和斜面垂直所以不做功，但正向力的作用是抵銷了外力垂直於斜面的分量，使得外力水平於斜面的分量可以發揮作用。

過程大致上如下所述

想像一下，我們有個均勻的磁場，他的方向和範圍是垂直穿進螢幕的上半平面，

再來，有個矩形迴路，下方掛著一個重物，矩形迴路本身質量可忽略不計，

迴路通上順時針方向的電流，則磁場在這段載流導線上施加的力，方向向上，

一旦電流大小適當，磁力和重力平衡，迴路就可以"懸吊"在磁場上。

這時加強電流，使得磁力約略大於重力，重物會被往上拉，

但做功的不是磁力，而是加強電流的那個東西，可能是電池或發電機。

磁場對電流造成了一個向上的力，使得導線得到一個向上的速度，

這個向上的速度，使得導線中的電荷在磁場中，又會造成一個向左的磁力，

和電流的方向相反，所以若電流要保持穩定，必須要有外力去對抗那個向左的磁力，

做功的就是這個外力。

**Example 5.3**  
- A rectangular loop of wire, supporting a mass $m$, hangs vertically with one end in a uniform magnetic field $B$, which points into the page in the shaded region of Fig. 5.10. 

- For what current $I$ in the loop would the magnetic force upward exactly balance the gravitational force downward?

**Solution**  
- First of all, the current must circulate clockwise in order for $(I \times B)$ in the horizontal segment to point upward. The force is  

$$
F_{\text{mag}} = I B a
$$

- where $a$ is the width of the loop. (The magnetic forces on the two vertical segments cancel.) 
- For $F_{\text{mag}}$ to balance the weight $mg$, we must therefore have  

$$
I = \frac{mg}{Ba}
$$

- The weight just hangs there, suspended in mid-air!  

- What happens if we now increase the current? 
- Then the upward magnetic force exceeds the downward force of gravity, and the loop rises, lifting the weight. 
- Somebody is doing work, and it sure looks as though the magnetic force is responsible. 
- Indeed, one is tempted to write  
$$
W_{\text{mag}} = F_{\text{mag}} h = I B a h
$$

- where $h$ is the distance the loop rises. 
- But we know that magnetic forces never do work. 
- What’s going on here?  

- Well, when the loop starts to rise, the charges in the wire are no longer moving horizontally—
  - their velocity now acquires an upward component $u$, the speed of the loop (Fig. 5.11), 
  - in addition to the horizontal component $w$ associated with the current ($I = \lambda w$). 
- The magnetic force, which is always perpendicular to the velocity, no longer points straight up, but tilts back. 
- It is perpendicular to the net displacement of the charge (which is in the direction of $v$), and therefore it does no work on $q$. 
- It does have a vertical component ($q w B$); indeed, the net vertical force on all the charge ($\lambda a$) in the upper segment of the loop is  
$$
F_{\text{vert}} = \lambda a w B = I B a
$$
- (as before); but now it also has a horizontal component ($q u B$), which opposes the flow of current. 
- Whoever is in charge of maintaining that current, therefore, must now push those charges along, against the backward component of the magnetic force.  

- The total horizontal force on the top segment is  
$$
F_{\text{horiz}} = \lambda a u B.
$$

- In a time $dt$, the charges move a (horizontal) distance $w dt$, so the work done by this agency (presumably a battery or a generator) is  
$$
W_{\text{battery}} = \lambda a B u w dt = I B a h,
$$

- which is precisely what we naïvely attributed to the magnetic force in Eq. (5.19). 
- Was work done in this process? Absolutely! 
- Who did it? The battery! 
- What, then, was the role of the magnetic force? 
- Well, it redirected the horizontal force of the battery into the vertical motion of the loop and the weight.

- It may help to consider a mechanical analogy. 
- Imagine you’re sliding a trunk up a frictionless ramp by pushing on it horizontally with a mop (Fig. 5.12). 
- The normal force ($N$) does no work because it is perpendicular to the displacement. 
- But it does have a vertical component (which in fact is what lifts the trunk), and a (backward) horizontal component (which you have to overcome by pushing on the mop). 
- Who is doing the work here? 
- You are, obviously—and yet your force (which is purely horizontal) is not (at least, not directly) what lifts the box. 
- The normal force plays the same passive (but crucial) role as the magnetic force in Ex. 5.3: while doing no work itself, it redirects the efforts of the active agent (you, or the battery, as the case may be), from horizontal to vertical.
