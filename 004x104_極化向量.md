**Polarization**

In the previous two sections, we have considered the effect of an external electric field on an individual atom or molecule. We are now in a position to answer (qualitatively) the original question: What happens to a piece of dielectric material when it is placed in an electric field?

If the substance consists of neutral atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the field will induce in each a tiny dipole moment, pointing in the same direction as the field. If the material is made up of polar molecules, each permanent dipole will experience a torque, tending to line it up along the field direction. (Random thermal motions compete with this process, so the alignment is never complete, especially at higher temperatures, and disappears almost at once when the field is removed.)

Notice that these two mechanisms produce the same basic result: a lot of little dipoles pointing along the direction of the field—the material becomes polarized. A convenient measure of this effect is:

\[
P \equiv \text{dipole moment per unit volume}
\]

which is called the polarization. From now on we shall not worry much about how the polarization got there. Actually, the two mechanisms I described are not as clear-cut as I tried to pretend. Even in polar molecules, there will be some polarization by displacement (though generally it is a lot easier to rotate a molecule than to stretch it, so the second mechanism dominates). It’s even possible in some materials to “freeze in” polarization, so that it persists after the field is removed.

But let’s forget for a moment about the cause of the polarization, and let’s study the field that a chunk of polarized material itself produces. Then, in Sect. 4.3, we’ll put it all together: the original field, which was responsible for \( P \), plus the new field, which is due to \( P \).
