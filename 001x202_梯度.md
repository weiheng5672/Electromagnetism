### Gradient

Suppose, now, that we have a function of three variables—say, the temperature $T(x, y, z)$ in this room. 

(Start out in one corner, and set up a system of axes; then for each point $(x, y, z)$ in the room, $T$ gives the temperature at that spot.) 

We want to generalize the notion of “derivative” to functions like $T$, which depend not on one but on three variables.

A derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies, if we move a little distance. 

But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends on what direction we move: If we go straight up, then the temperature will probably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much at all. 

In fact, the question “How fast does $T$ vary?” has an infinite number of answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore.

Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. 

A theorem on partial derivatives states that

$$
dT = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} dy + \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} dz
$$

This tells us how $T$ changes when we alter all three variables by the infinitesimal amounts $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$. 

Notice that we do not require an infinite number of derivatives—three will suffice: the partial derivatives along each of the three coordinate directions.

Equation (1.34) is reminiscent of a dot product:

$$
dT =
\left(
\hat{x}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}+
\hat{y}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}+
\hat{z}\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
\right) 
\cdot (\hat{x}dx + \hat{y}dy + \hat{z}dz )
$$

$$
= \nabla T \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

where

$$
\nabla T \equiv
\hat{x}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}+
\hat{y}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}+
\hat{z}\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
$$

is the **gradient** of $T$. Note that $\nabla T$ is a vector quantity, with three components; it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. 

Equation (1.35) is the three-dimensional version of

$$
df = \left( \frac{df}{dx} \right) dx
$$

### Geometrical Interpretation of the Gradient

Like any vector, the gradient has magnitude and direction. 

To determine its geometrical meaning, let’s rewrite the dot product (Eq. 1.35) using Eq. (1.1):

$$
dT = \nabla T \cdot d\vec{l} = |\nabla T|\, |d\vec{l}| \cos \theta
\tag{1.37}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\nabla T$ and $d\vec{l}$. 

Now, if we fix the magnitude $|d\vec{l}|$ and search around in various directions (that is, vary $\theta$), the maximum change in $T$ evidently occurs when $\theta = 0$ (for then $\cos \theta = 1$). 

That is, for a fixed distance $|d\vec{l}|$, $dT$ is greatest when we move in the same direction as $\nabla T$. 

Thus:

> The gradient $\nabla T$ points in the direction of **maximum increase** of the function $T$.

Moreover:

> The magnitude $|\nabla T|$ gives the **slope (rate of increase)** along this maximal direction.

Imagine you are standing on a hillside. 

Look all around you, and find the direction of steepest ascent. 

That is the direction of the gradient. 

Now measure the slope in that direction (rise over run). 

That is the magnitude of the gradient. 

(Here the function we’re talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it depends on are positions—latitude and longitude, say. 

This function depends on only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier to grasp in two dimensions.)

Notice from Eq. (1.37) that the direction of **maximum descent** is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles ($\theta = 90^\circ$) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines).

You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always have “kinks” in them, and correspond to **nondifferentiable functions**.

### What would it mean for the gradient to vanish?

If $\nabla T = 0$ at $(x, y, z)$, then $dT = 0$ for small displacements about the point $(x, y, z)$. 

This is, then, a **stationary point** of the function $T(x, y, z)$. 

It could be a **maximum** (a summit), a **minimum** (a valley), a **saddle point** (a pass), or a “shoulder.” 

This is analogous to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection. 

In particular, if you want to locate the extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero.

如果我有一個函數 $T(x, y, z)$，像是房間裡的溫度場，問問自己：$dT$ 是什麼？   

它代表的就是這個函數的一個極微小變化，是一個 infinitesimal 的變化量。

我們想知道，如果在空間中任意移動一小步，$T$ 會怎麼改變？這時候，dT 跟 dx、dy、dz 有什麼關係？

答案是：  
$$
dT = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} dy + \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} dz
$$  
這就是我們要的，它是導數概念在多變數下的延伸。

但這還不夠精簡。我們可以觀察，這整個式子看起來其實就是一個點積（dot product）：

$$
dT = \nabla T \cdot d\vec{l}
$$  
其中  
$$
\nabla T = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \hat{x} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \hat{y} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \hat{z}
$$  
就是我們在找的那個「推廣」：把一維裡的 $df/dx$ 推廣成三維空間裡的變化率向量，也就是 gradient。

所以整體來看，向量微積分並不真的比較難，只是把「導數是變化率」這個概念，從單一方向（x 軸）推廣到任意方向（空間中的任意方向向量 $d\vec{l}$）。  
差別只在這裡而已。
