### **Laplace’s Equation in Two Dimensions**  

If $V$ depends on two variables, Laplace’s equation becomes  

$$
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial y^2} = 0.
$$

- This is no longer an ordinary differential equation 
  - (that is, one involving ordinary derivatives only); 
- it is a partial differential equation. 
- As a consequence, some of the simple rules you may be familiar with do not apply. 
  - For instance, the general solution to this equation doesn’t contain just two arbitrary constants
  - —or, for that matter, any finite number—
  - despite the fact that it’s a second-order equation. 
  - Indeed, one cannot write down a “general solution” (at least, not in a closed form). 
  - Nevertheless, it is possible to deduce certain properties common to all solutions.  

- It may help to have a physical example in mind. 
  - Picture a thin rubber sheet (or a soap film) stretched over some support. 
  - For definiteness, suppose you take a cardboard box, 
  - cut a wavy line all the way around, and remove the top part. 
  - Now glue a tightly stretched rubber membrane over the box, 
  - so that it fits like a drumhead 
    - (it won’t be a flat drumhead, of course, unless you chose to cut the edges off straight). 
  - Now, if you lay out coordinates $(x, y)$ on the bottom of the box, 
  - the height $V(x, y)$ of the sheet above the point $(x, y)$ will satisfy Laplace’s equation. 
  - (The one-dimensional analog would be a rubber band stretched between two points. 
  - Of course, it would form a straight line.)  

Harmonic functions in two dimensions have the same properties we noted in one dimension:  

1. **The value of $V$ at a point $(x, y)$ is the average of those around the point.**  
   - More precisely, if you draw a circle of any radius $R$ about the point $(x, y)$, 
   - the average value of $V$ on the circle is equal to the value at the center:  

   $$
   V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi R} \oint_{\text{circle}} V \, dl.
   $$

   - (This, incidentally, suggests the method of relaxation, 
     - on which computer solutions to Laplace’s equation are based: 
     - Starting with specified values for $V$ at the boundary, 
     - and reasonable guesses for $V$ on a grid of interior points, 
     - the first pass reassigns to each point the average of its nearest neighbors. 
     - The second pass repeats the process, using the corrected values, and so on. 
     - After a few iterations, the numbers begin to settle down, 
     - so that subsequent passes produce negligible changes, 
     - and a numerical solution to Laplace’s equation, with the given boundary values, has been achieved.)

2. **$ V $ has no local maxima or minima; all extrema occur at the boundaries.**  
   - (As before, this follows from (1).) 
   - Again, Laplace’s equation picks the most featureless function possible, 
     - consistent with the boundary conditions: 
     - no hills, 
     - no valleys, 
     - just the smoothest conceivable surface.  

   - For instance, if you put a ping-pong ball on the stretched rubber sheet, 
     - it will roll over to one side and fall off—
     - it will not find a “pocket” somewhere to settle into, 
     - for Laplace’s equation allows no such dents in the surface.  

   - From a geometrical point of view, 
     - just as a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, 
     - so a harmonic function in two dimensions minimizes the surface area spanning the given boundary line.

- 在二維空間中，這個性質雖然較難直接推導，但仍然成立。
- 具體而言，二維拉普拉斯方程的解在某點的值，等於以該點為圓心的某個圓周上解的平均值，即：  

$$
V(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{\partial B} V(\mathbf{x'}) \, dS
$$  

- 這個結論的嚴格證明較為困難，但我們可以從數值方法的角度來理解。
- 數值求解拉普拉斯方程時，常用**五點格式**（Five-point stencil）離散化：  

$$
V_{i,j} = \frac{1}{4} (V_{i+1,j} + V_{i-1,j} + V_{i,j+1} + V_{i,j-1})
$$  

- 這意味著，每個格點的電位值都是其前後左右四個鄰近格點值的平均。
- 這種離散化方法不僅是數值求解的標準技術，同時也是拉普拉斯方程**平均性質**的一種直接應用。
