# DKCheng 介紹靜磁學的脈絡

原文呈現，第6-1節的所有內容

- In Chapter 3, we dealt with static electric fields caused by electric charges at rest.
- We saw that electric field intensity **E** is the only fundamental vector field quantity required for the study of electrostatics in free space.
- In a material medium, it is convenient to define a second vector field quantity, the electric flux density (or electric displacement) **D**, to account for the effect of polarization. 
- The following two equations form the basis of the electrostatic model:  

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho
\]  


\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0
\]  

- The electrical property of the medium determines the relation between **D** and **E**.
- If the medium is linear and isotropic, we have the simple constitutive relation **D** = ε**E**, where the permittivity **ε** is a scalar.
- When a small test charge **q** is placed in an electric field **E**, it experiences an electric force **Fₑ**, which is a function of the position of **q**.

We have  

\[
\mathbf{F}_e = q \mathbf{E} \quad (\text{N}).
\]  
 

When the test charge is in motion in a magnetic field (to be defined presently), experiments show that it experiences another force, **Fₘ**, which has the following characteristics:  

1. The magnitude of **Fₘ** is proportional to **q**.  
2. The direction of **Fₘ** at any point is at right angles to the velocity vector of the test charge as well as to **a fixed direction at that point**.  
1. The magnitude of **Fₘ** is also proportional to the component of the velocity at right angles to **this fixed direction**.  

- The force **Fₘ** is a magnetic force; it cannot be expressed in terms of **E** or **D**.
- The characteristics of **Fₘ** can be described by defining a new vector field quantity, the magnetic flux density **B**, that specifies both **the fixed direction** and the constant of proportionality. 
  
In SI units, the magnetic force can be expressed as  

\[
\mathbf{F}_m = q \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B} \quad (\text{N})
\]  


where **u** (m/s) is the velocity vector, and **B** is measured in webers per square meter (Wb/m²) or teslas (T).  

The total electromagnetic force on a charge **q** is then  

\[
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_e + \mathbf{F}_m
\]  

that is,  

\[
\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B}) \quad (\text{N})
\]  

which is called **Lorentz's force equation**.

- Its validity has been unquestionably established by experiments.
- We may consider **F/q** for a small **q** as the definition for electric field intensity **E** (as we did in Eq. 3-2), and **F/q = u × B** as the defining relation for magnetic flux density **B**.(然而，DKCheng沒這麼做)
- Alternatively, we may consider **Lorentz's force equation** as a fundamental postulate of our electromagnetic model; it cannot be derived from other postulates.  
- We begin the study of static magnetic fields in free space with two postulates specifying the divergence and the curl of **B**. 
- From the solenoidal character of **B**, a vector magnetic potential is defined, which is shown to obey a vector Poisson’s equation. 
- Next, we derive the **Biot-Savart law**, which can be used to determine the magnetic field of a current-carrying circuit. 
- The postulated curl relation leads directly to **Ampere’s circuital law**, which is particularly useful when symmetry exists.  
- The macroscopic effect of magnetic materials in a magnetic field can be studied by defining a **magnetization vector**. 
- Here, we introduce a fourth vector field quantity, the **magnetic field intensity H**. 
- From the relation between **B** and **H**, we define the **permeability** of the material, following which we discuss **magnetic circuits** and the microscopic behavior of magnetic materials. 
- We then examine the boundary conditions of **B** and **H** at the interface of two different magnetic media; **self- and mutual inductances**; and **magnetic energy, forces, and torques**.

以上是 DKCheng 介紹靜磁學的脈絡，原文呈現，第6-1節的所有內容。

- 學習靜磁學最速成的方式也就是把**馬克斯威方程式+勞侖茲力定律**作為出發點。
- 在經典電磁學層次，馬克士威方程敘述了電荷如何造成場，勞侖茲力敘述場對電荷的作用。
- DKCheng沒有利用勞倫茲力去定義磁場，而是透過勞倫茲力，去認識磁場的存在。 
- 從B的旋度、B的散度出發，推導出：安培定律、向量磁位、畢歐沙伐、安培力。
- 這正是DKCheng的做法，這種路線可以非常精簡的介紹整個靜磁學。
- 但即使是這種路線，依然要在這部分進行一些說明，而不是一開始就一頭栽進數學推導中。
- 這段陳述其實蘊含著經典電磁學的認知邊界，以及最底層的邏輯。
- 在靜電學最一開始的時候，表述庫倫定律有一個革命性的認知突破：
    + 看似只是在庫倫定律的等號兩邊，同除其中一個電荷而已，看似就只是單位電荷上的力。
    + 但它不僅僅是單位電荷上的力，本質上是去度量一種，即使這裡沒有電荷存在，依然存在於該位置的物理實在，也就是電場。

- 馬克思威爾方程其中的：電場的散度等於該點的電荷密度。這其實可以從庫倫定律推導得到。
- 也就是說，在靜電學的範疇中，電荷如何產生場，以及場如何對電荷作用，本質都是庫倫定律。
- 但是在靜磁學，情況不同了，電荷如何產生磁場，磁場如何對電荷造成影響，是兩種機制。
- 這代表在馬克思威爾方程中看似對稱的電場和磁場，其實有本質上的不對稱性，認識到經典電磁學的這種不對稱性，非常關鍵。

# Griffith介紹靜磁學

以下是Griffith介紹靜磁學的出發點

To give you some sense of what is in store, imagine the following demonstration: Two wires hang from the ceiling, a few centimeters apart. When I turn on a current, so that it passes up one wire and back down the other, the wires jump apart—they evidently repel one another (Fig. 5.2(a)). How do we explain this?

You might suppose that the battery (or whatever drives the current) is actually charging up the wires and that the force is simply due to the electrical repulsion of like charges. But this is incorrect. I could hold up a test charge near these wires, and there would be no force on it, for the wires are in fact electrically neutral. It’s true that electrons are flowing down the line—that’s what a current is—but on any given segment, there are just as many stationary positive charges as moving negative charges. Moreover, if I hook up my demonstration so that the current flows up both wires (Fig. 5.2(b)), they are found to attract!

Whatever force accounts for the attraction of parallel currents and the repulsion of antiparallel ones is not electrostatic in nature. It is our first encounter with a magnetic force. Whereas a stationary charge produces only an electric field E in the space around it, a moving charge generates, in addition, a magnetic field B. In fact, magnetic fields are much easier to detect in practice—all you need is a Boy Scout compass. The details of how these devices work are irrelevant at the moment; it is enough to know that the needle points in the direction of the local magnetic field. Ordinarily, this means north, in response to the Earth’s magnetic field, but in the laboratory, where typical fields may be hundreds of times stronger, the compass indicates the direction of whatever magnetic field is present.

Now, if you hold up a tiny compass near a current-carrying wire, you quickly discover something peculiar: The field does not point toward the wire or away from it but rather circles around the wire. In fact, if you grab the wire with your right hand—thumb in the direction of the current—your fingers curl around in the direction of the magnetic field (Fig. 5.3).

How can such a field lead to a force of attraction on a nearby parallel current? At the second wire, the magnetic field points into the page (Fig. 5.4), the current is upward, and yet the resulting force is to the left! It’s going to take a strange law to account for these directions.

- 這部分是很好的補充，學習靜磁學最好是以DKCheng為主線，Griffith為補充。
- Griffith 具體且簡短介紹磁力現象的實驗，是怎麼觀察到有別於靜電力的現象，而DKCheng只是抽象的把正確結果呈現。
- 引入磁針，把DKCheng所述的所謂某個固定方向，明確指出其實就是磁針測量磁場指出的方向。

# 名詞細節
- Griffith沒有使用磁通量密度(magnetic flux density)去精確稱呼B，而是用更模糊的磁場(magnetic field)。
- 這是因為在靜磁學，磁通量密度意義確實還不明確，要等到電磁感應才知道這稱呼的意義。
- 但由於DKCheng是從B的散度作為出發點，他不得不提前引入這個意義還不太明確的名詞。

# 有關磁場方向的補充

關於為何不能把磁力方向視為磁場方向，這裡再提供另一種角度。

We wish now to speak of electric and magnetic fields at a point even when there is no charge present. We are saying, in effect, that since there are forces “acting on” the charge, there is still “something” there when the charge is removed.

這是費曼在物理學講義第二冊第一章的一段話，搭配Griffith的實驗圖像，有以下陳述：

- 載流導線會對周遭的磁針，造成影響
- 載流導線會對另一根載流導線，造成影響
    + 電流同向，吸引
    + 電流反向，排斥
- 力的方向隨電流的不同而不同，力不是**當我們把受力的載流導線或者受影響的磁針拿走後**，在那個位置上，依然存在的東西。
- 我們認為，電流會在空間產生一種東西，稱之為磁場，另一個載流導線或磁針，在磁場的作用下導致吸引、排斥或偏轉。
- 我們把磁針的指向，定義為磁場的方向。
