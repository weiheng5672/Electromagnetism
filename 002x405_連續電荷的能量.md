\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i V ( r_i )   \quad (1)
\]

- That’s how much work it takes to assemble a configuration of point charges.
- it’s also the amount of work you’d get back if you dismantled the system. 
- In the meantime, it represents energy stored in the configuration.


For a volume charge density \( \rho \),  (1) becomes  

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho V \, d\tau \quad (2)
\]

(The corresponding integrals for line and surface charges would be  \(\int \lambda V \, dl\) and \(\int \sigma V \, da\).)  

There is a lovely way to rewrite this result, in which \( \rho \) and \( V \) are eliminated in favor of \( E \). First use Gauss’s law to express \( \rho \) in terms of \( E \):  

\[
\rho = \varepsilon_0 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E}
\]

so  

\[
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int (\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{E}) V \, d\tau
\]

Now use integration by parts (Eq. 1.59) to transfer the derivative from \( E \) to \( V \):  

\[
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}  
\left( - \int \vec{E} \cdot (\vec{\nabla} V) \, d\tau + \oint V \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{a} \right)
\]

But \( \vec{\nabla} V = - \vec{E} \), so  

\[
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}  
\left( \int  E^2 \, d\tau + \oint_S V \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{a} \right) \quad (3)
\]

But what volume is this we’re integrating over? Let’s go back to the formula we started with, Eq. 2.43. From its derivation, it is clear that we should integrate over the region where the charge is located. But actually, any larger volume would do just as well: The “extra” territory we throw in will contribute nothing to the integral, since \( \rho = 0 \) out there.  

With this in mind, we return to Eq. 2.44. What happens here, as we enlarge the volume beyond the minimum necessary to trap all the charge? Well, the integral of \( E^2 \) can only increase (the integrand being positive); evidently, the surface integral must decrease correspondingly to leave the sum intact. (In fact, at large distances from the charge, \( E \) goes like \( 1/r^2 \) and \( V \) like \( 1/r \), while the surface area grows like \( r^2 \); roughly speaking, then, the surface integral goes down like \( 1/r \).)  

Please understand: Eq. 2.44 gives you the correct energy \( W \), whatever volume you use (as long as it encloses all the charge), but the contribution from the volume integral goes up, and that of the surface integral goes down, as you take larger and larger volumes.  

In particular, why not integrate over all space? Then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with  

\[
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int_{all \, space} E^2 \, d\tau  \quad (4)
\]
