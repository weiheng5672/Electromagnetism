### Example 4.2. 

- Find the electric ﬁeld 
  - produced by 
  - a uniformly polarized sphere of radius R.

### 解

- We may as well choose the $z$-axis to coincide with the direction of polarization. 
- The volume bound charge density $\rho_b$ is zero since $P$ is uniform, but  
$$
\sigma_b = P \cdot \hat{n} = P \cos\theta,
$$

  - where $\theta$ is the usual spherical coordinate. 
- What we want, then, is the field 
  - produced by a charge density $P \cos\theta$ 
  - plastered over the surface of a sphere. 
- But we already computed the potential of such a configuration in Ex. 3.9:
$$
V(r, \theta) =
\begin{cases} 
\displaystyle \frac{P}{3 \varepsilon_0} r \cos\theta & \text{for}\quad r \leq R, 
\\
\\
\displaystyle \frac{P}{3 \varepsilon_0} \frac{R^3}{r^2} \cos\theta & \text{for}\quad r \geq R
\end{cases}
$$


- Since $r \cos\theta = z$, the field inside the sphere is uniform:
$$
E = -\nabla V = -\frac{P}{3\varepsilon_0} \hat{z} = -\frac{\mathbf{P}}{3\varepsilon_0} \quad \text{for}\quad r < R.
$$

- This remarkable result will be very useful in what follows. 
- Outside the sphere, 
  - the potential is identical to that of 
  - a perfect dipole at the origin:
$$
V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{p \cdot \hat{r}}{r^2} \quad \text{for} \quad  r \geq R,
$$

- whose dipole moment is, not surprisingly, 
  - equal to the total dipole moment of the sphere:
$$
p = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 P.
$$
