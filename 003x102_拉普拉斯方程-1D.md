**Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension**  

Suppose \( V \) depends on only one variable, \( x \). Then Laplace’s equation becomes  

\[
\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = 0.
\]

The general solution is  

\[
V(x) = mx + b,
\]

the equation for a straight line. It contains two undetermined constants (\( m \) and \( b \)), as is appropriate for a second-order (ordinary) differential equation. They are fixed, in any particular case, by the boundary conditions of that problem. For instance, it might be specified that \( V = 4 \) at \( x = 1 \), and \( V = 0 \) at \( x = 5 \). In that case, \( m = -1 \) and \( b = 5 \), so  

\[
V = -x + 5
\]

(see Fig. 3.1).  

I want to call your attention to two features of this result; they may seem silly and obvious in one dimension, where I can write down the general solution explicitly, but the analogs in two and three dimensions are powerful and by no means obvious:  

1. \( V(x) \) is the average of \( V(x + a) \) and \( V(x - a) \), for any \( a \):  

   \[
   V(x) = \frac{1}{2} [V(x + a) + V(x - a)].
   \]

   Laplace’s equation is a kind of averaging instruction; it tells you to assign to the point \( x \) the average of the values to the left and to the right of \( x \). Solutions to Laplace’s equation are, in this sense, as boring as they could possibly be, and yet fit the end points properly.  

2. Laplace’s equation tolerates no local maxima or minima; extreme values of \( V \) must occur at the end points. Actually, this is a consequence of (1), for if there were a local maximum, \( V \) would be greater at that point than on either side, and therefore could not be the average. (Ordinarily, you expect the second derivative to be negative at a maximum and positive at a minimum. Since Laplace’s equation requires, on the contrary, that the second derivative is zero, it seems reasonable that solutions should exhibit no extrema. However, this is not a proof, since there exist functions that have maxima and minima at points where the second derivative vanishes: \( x^4 \), for example, has such a minimum at the point \( x = 0 \).)

在一維情況下，拉普拉斯方程簡化為二階常微分方程：  

\[
\frac{d^2 V}{dx^2} = 0
\]  

其解是一條直線，即 \( V(x) = ax + b \)，其中 \( a, b \) 為待定常數。
為求解此方程，需給定兩個邊界條件。
對於一條直線上的任一點，該點的值確實是它周圍點的平均。
為什麼？  

- 若直線是水平的（即 \( a = 0 \)），則所有點的值都相同，任意點的值自然等於周圍點的平均。  
- 若直線有斜率（即 \( a \neq 0 \)），則其上任意點的一側值較大，另一側值較小，而該點往兩側等距移動，函數值會以相同的量增減，因此該點的值仍是其周圍點的平均。  
- 若直線垂直，則不再是函數，因為單一 \( x \) 對應多個 \( V(x) \)，違反函數定義，因此不考慮此情況。  

- 這種平均性質有一個重要推論：**極值總是發生在邊界上**。  

- 我們可以用反證法來說明：
  - 假設極值不在邊界，而出現在內部某點。
  - 然而，由於該點的值是周圍點的平均，
  - 因此該點的值不可能比周圍所有點都大或都小，
  - 這與極值的定義矛盾。
  - 因此，極值必定發生在邊界上。
