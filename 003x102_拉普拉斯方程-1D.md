**Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension**  

Suppose \( V \) depends on only one variable, \( x \). Then Laplace’s equation becomes  

\[
\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = 0.
\]

The general solution is  

\[
V(x) = mx + b,
\]

the equation for a straight line. It contains two undetermined constants (\( m \) and \( b \)), as is appropriate for a second-order (ordinary) differential equation. They are fixed, in any particular case, by the boundary conditions of that problem. For instance, it might be specified that \( V = 4 \) at \( x = 1 \), and \( V = 0 \) at \( x = 5 \). In that case, \( m = -1 \) and \( b = 5 \), so  

\[
V = -x + 5
\]

(see Fig. 3.1).  

I want to call your attention to two features of this result; they may seem silly and obvious in one dimension, where I can write down the general solution explicitly, but the analogs in two and three dimensions are powerful and by no means obvious:  

1. \( V(x) \) is the average of \( V(x + a) \) and \( V(x - a) \), for any \( a \):  

   \[
   V(x) = \frac{1}{2} [V(x + a) + V(x - a)].
   \]

   Laplace’s equation is a kind of averaging instruction; it tells you to assign to the point \( x \) the average of the values to the left and to the right of \( x \). Solutions to Laplace’s equation are, in this sense, as boring as they could possibly be, and yet fit the end points properly.  

2. Laplace’s equation tolerates no local maxima or minima; extreme values of \( V \) must occur at the end points. Actually, this is a consequence of (1), for if there were a local maximum, \( V \) would be greater at that point than on either side, and therefore could not be the average. (Ordinarily, you expect the second derivative to be negative at a maximum and positive at a minimum. Since Laplace’s equation requires, on the contrary, that the second derivative is zero, it seems reasonable that solutions should exhibit no extrema. However, this is not a proof, since there exist functions that have maxima and minima at points where the second derivative vanishes: \( x^4 \), for example, has such a minimum at the point \( x = 0 \).)
