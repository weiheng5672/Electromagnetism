### 前言
- 這段作者的論述很subtle(直譯是精妙)，意思是不容易直觀理解，需要仔細推敲。
- 為了精準理解作者的表達，筆記原本有包含英文的學習(已刪除，修改紀錄中可檢視)。
- 原本的我的理解也全數刪除，因為我自己後來看，發現並沒有原文好懂。
- 有些表述約等於翻譯，但有些概念不太容易用中文表達。
- 這邊改為重點提示作者的敘述重點。

### 重點
- 這部分在說明，使用連續的向量場 $\vec{P}$，表示一塊介電物質的合理性。
- 合理性的關鍵在於，在物質內部的某個位置，宏觀尺度下的電場，是一種平均的概念。
- 電場針對某個合適體積的平均值，the average field over a sphere，作者使用的是球形區域。
$$
\frac{1}{\text{V的體積}} \int_V \vec{E}\,d\tau
$$
- 這個積分不會直接去算，在習題3-47中，討論了一種非常trick的手法，可以得到結果。
- 習題3-47是理解作者陳述的前置條件。
- 習題3-47並沒有 $\vec{P}$、介電物質的概念，但所謂的介電物質，就是一群正負分離的電荷。

### 論述的脈絡
- 挖空一塊球型區域(a sphere)，將 the average field over the sphere 分成兩部分
- 球內、球外介電物質(一群正負分離的電荷)的貢獻。
- 球型區域相對於整塊介電物質要非常小
  - 一來，平均電場仍然可以抓住宏觀的變化細節。
  - 二來，$\vec{P}$ 在球型區域可視為均勻，被挖空的球型區域，是一個均勻極化球。
- 球型區域相較於介電物質的分子又夠大，
  - 使得球心與介電物質的距離夠遠，確實可以將介電物質當作是連續的向量場 $\vec{P}$。

- 微觀層面，球內介電物質，不能使用連續的向量場 $\vec{P}$ 表示。
  - 但如果是計算宏觀尺度下的的電場，仍舊可以。
  - 即便微觀尺度電場的混亂的、甚至也不可能是靜電場。
  - 球內介電物質也可以使用連續的向量場 $\vec{P}$ 表示。

- I have been sloppy about the distinction between “pure” dipoles and “physical” dipoles.
- In developing the theory of bound charges, I assumed we were working with the pure kind—indeed, I started with the formula for the potential of a perfect dipole. 
$$
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\vec{p}\cdot\hat{\gamma}}{\gamma^2}
$$

- And yet, an actual polarized dielectric consists of physical dipoles, albeit extremely tiny ones. 
- What is more, I presumed to represent discrete molecular dipoles by a continuous density function $P$ .
- How can I justify this method?

---  
- Outside the dielectric, there is no real problem: 
  - here we are far away from the molecules 
  - (r is many times greater than the separation distance between plus and minus charges), 
  - so the dipole potential dominates overwhelmingly 
  - and the detailed “graininess” of the source is blurred by distance. 

---
- Inside the dielectric, however, 
  - we can hardly pretend to be far from all the dipoles, 
  - and the procedure I used in Sect. 4.2.1 is open to serious challenge.
- In fact, when you stop to think about it, 
  - the electric field inside matter must be fantastically complicated on the microscopic level. 
  - If you happen to be very near an electron, the field is gigantic, 
  - whereas a short distance away, it may be small or may point in a totally different direction. 
  - Moreover, an instant later, as the atoms move about, the field will have altered entirely. 
  - This true microscopic field would be utterly impossible to calculate, 
  - nor would it be of much interest if you could.

---
- Just as, for macroscopic purposes, we regard water as a continuous fluid, ignoring its molecular structure, 
- so also we can ignore the microscopic bumps and wrinkles in the electric field inside matter and concentrate on the macroscopic field. 
- This is defined as the average field over regions large enough to contain many thousands of atoms (so that the uninteresting microscopic fluctuations are smoothed over), 
- and yet small enough to ensure that we do not wash out any significant large-scale variations in the field. 
- (In practice, this means we must average over regions much smaller than the dimensions of the object itself.) 
- Ordinarily, the macroscopic field is what people mean when they speak of “the” field inside matter.  

---
- It remains to show that the macroscopic field is what we actually obtain when we use the methods of Sect. 4.2.1. The argument is subtle, so hang on.
- Suppose I want to calculate the macroscopic field at some point $\mathbf{r}$ within a dielectric. 
- I know I must average the true (microscopic) field over an appropriate volume, 
- so let me draw a small sphere about $\mathbf{r}$, of radius, say, a thousand times the size of a molecule. 
- The macroscopic field at $\mathbf{r}$, then, consists of two parts: 
  - the average field over the sphere due to all charges outside, 
  - plus the average due to all charges inside:
$$
\vec{E} = \vec{E}_{\text{out}} + \vec{E}_{\text{in}}.
$$

---
- You proved in Prob. 3.47(d) that 
  - the average field (over a sphere), 
  - produced by charges outside, 
  - is equal to the field 
  - they produce at the center, 
- so $\vec{E}_{\text{out}}$ is the field at $\mathbf{r}$ due to the dipoles exterior to the sphere. 
- These are far enough away that we can safely use:
$$
V_{\text{out}}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int_{\text{outside}} \frac{\vec{P}(\mathbf{r'}) \cdot \hat{\gamma}}{\gamma^2} d\tau'
$$

---

- The dipoles inside the sphere are too close to treat in this fashion. 
- But fortunately, all we need is their average field, and that, according to Prob. 3.47, is:
$$
\vec{E}_{\text{in}} = -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{\vec{p}}{R^3}
$$

- regardless of the details of the charge distribution within the sphere. 
- The only relevant quantity is the total dipole moment,
$$
\vec{p} = \left(\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3\right) \vec{P}
$$

- so that
$$
\vec{E}_{\text{in}} = -\frac{1}{3\varepsilon_0} \vec{P}
$$

- Now, by assumption, the sphere is small enough that $\vec{P}$ does not vary significantly over its volume, 
- so the term left out of the integral in $V_{\text{out}}(\mathbf{r})$ corresponds to 
  - the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere, 
  - which is precisely $-(1/3ε₀)P$. 
- But this is exactly what $\vec{E}_in$ puts back in!  

---

- The macroscopic field, then, is given by the potential:
$$
V(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int \frac{\vec{P}(\mathbf{r'}) \cdot \hat{\gamma}}{\gamma^2} d\tau',
$$

- where the integral runs over the entire volume of the dielectric. 
- This is, of course, what we used in Sect. 4.2.1; without realizing it, we were correctly calculating the averaged, macroscopic field for points inside the dielectric.  


---
- You may have to reread the last couple of paragraphs for the argument to sink in. 
- Notice that it all revolves around the curious fact that 
  - the average field over any sphere (due to the charge inside) 
  - is the same as 
  - the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere with the same total dipole moment. 
- This means that no matter how crazy the actual microscopic charge configuration, we can replace it by a nice smooth distribution of perfect dipoles if all we want is the macroscopic (average) field.  

- Incidentally, while the argument ostensibly relies on the spherical shape I chose to average over, the macroscopic field is certainly independent of the geometry of the averaging region, and this is reflected in the final answer, Eq. 4.19. 
- Presumably, one could reproduce the same argument for a cube or an ellipsoid or whatever—the calculation might be more difficult, but the conclusion would be the same.
