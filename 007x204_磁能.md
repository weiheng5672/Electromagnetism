**Energy in Magnetic Fields**  

It takes a certain amount of energy to start a current flowing in a circuit. 

I’m not talking about the energy delivered to the resistors and converted into heat—that is irretrievably lost, as far as the circuit is concerned, and can be large or small, depending on how long you let the current run. 

What I am concerned with, rather, is the work you must do against the back emf to get the current going. 

This is a fixed amount, and it is recoverable: you get it back when the current is turned off. 

In the meantime, it represents energy latent in the circuit; as we’ll see in a moment, it can be regarded as energy stored in the magnetic field.

The work done on a unit charge, against the back emf, in one trip around the circuit is $-\mathcal{E}$ (the minus sign records the fact that this is the work done by you against the emf, not the work done by the emf). 

The amount of charge per unit time passing down the wire is $I$. So the total work done per unit time is  

$$
\frac{dW}{dt} = -\mathcal{E} I = L I \frac{dI}{dt}
$$

If we start with zero current and build it up to a final value $I$, the work done (integrating the last equation over time) is  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 \tag{7.30}
$$

It does not depend on how long we take to crank up the current, only on the geometry of the loop (in the form of $L$) and the final current $I$.  

There is a nicer way to write $W$, which has the advantage that it is readily generalized to surface and volume currents. 

Remember that the flux $\Phi$ through the loop is equal to $L I$. 

On the other hand,  
$$
\Phi = \int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{a}
$$

$$
= \int (\nabla \times \vec{A}) \cdot d\vec{a} = \oint \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

where the line integral is around the perimeter of the loop. 

Thus,  
$$
L I = \oint \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

and therefore  
$$
W = \frac{1}{2} I \oint \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \oint  \vec{A} \cdot \vec{I} \, dl \tag{7.31}
$$

In this form, the generalization to volume currents is obvious:  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} \int_V  \vec{A} \cdot \vec{J} \, d\tau \tag{7.32}
$$

But we can do even better and express $W$ entirely in terms of the magnetic field: Ampère’s law, $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J}$, lets us eliminate $\vec{J}$:  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \int_V \vec{A} \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B}) d\tau \tag{7.33}
$$

Integration by parts transfers the derivative from $B$ to $A$; specifically, the product rule states that  

$$
\nabla \cdot (\vec{A} \times \vec{B}) = \vec{B} \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{A}) - \vec{A} \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B})
$$

so  

$$
\vec{A} \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B}) = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{B} - \nabla \cdot (\vec{A} \times \vec{B})
$$

Consequently,

$$
W = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \left[ \int_V B^2 d\tau - \int_V \nabla \cdot (\vec{A} \times \vec{B}) d\tau \right] 
$$

Using the divergence theorem,  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \left[ \int_V B^2 d\tau - \oint_S (\vec{A} \times \vec{B}) \cdot d\vec{a} \right] \tag{7.34}
$$

where $S$ is the surface bounding the volume $V$.  

Now, the integration in Eq. 7.32 is to be taken over the entire volume occupied by the current. 

But any region larger than this will do just as well, for $J$ is zero out there anyway. 

In Eq. 7.34, the larger the region we pick, the greater is the contribution from the volume integral, and therefore the smaller is that of the surface integral (this makes sense: as the surface gets farther from the current, both $A$ and $B$ decrease). 

In particular, if we agree to integrate over all space, then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \int_{\text{all space}} B^2 d\tau \tag{7.35}
$$

In view of this result, we say the energy is “stored in the magnetic field,” in the amount $(B^2 / 2\mu_0)$ per unit volume. 

This is a nice way to think of it, though someone looking at Eq. 7.32 might prefer to say that the energy is stored in the current distribution, in the amount $\frac{1}{2}\vec{A} \cdot \vec{J}$ per unit volume. 

The distinction is one of bookkeeping; the important quantity is the total energy $W$, and we need not worry about where (if anywhere) the energy is “located.”  

You might find it strange that it takes energy to set up a magnetic field—after all, magnetic fields themselves do no work. 

The point is that producing a magnetic field, where previously there was none, requires changing the field, and a changing $B$-field, according to Faraday, induces an electric field. 

The latter, of course, can do work. 

In the beginning, there is no $E$, and at the end, there is no $E$; but in between, while $B$ is building up, there is an $E$, and it is against this that the work is done. 

(You see why I could not calculate the energy stored in a magnetostatic field back in Chapter 5.)  

In light of this, it is extraordinary how similar the magnetic energy formulas are to their electrostatic counterparts:  

$$
W_{\text{elec}} = \frac{1}{2} \int V \rho \, d\tau = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int E^2 d\tau
$$

$$
W_{\text{mag}} = \frac{1}{2} \int \vec{A} \cdot \vec{J} \, d\tau = \frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \int B^2 d\tau
$$

### 計算電感

**Example 7.13**

A long coaxial cable carries current $I$ (the current flows down the surface of the inner cylinder, radius $a$, and back along the outer cylinder, radius $b$) as shown in Fig. 7.40. 

![Figure 7.40](Figs/FIGURE%207.40.png)

Find the magnetic energy stored in a section of length $l$.  

**Solution**

According to Ampère’s law, the field between the cylinders is  

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi s} \hat{\phi}
$$

Elsewhere, the field is zero. Thus, the energy per unit volume is  

$$
\frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \left( \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi s} \right)^2 = \frac{\mu_0 I^2}{8 \pi^2 s^2}
$$

The energy in a cylindrical shell of length $l$, radius $s$, and thickness $ds$, then, is  

$$
\frac{\mu_0 I^2}{8 \pi^2 s^2} \cdot 2 \pi l s \, ds = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{4 \pi} \frac{ds}{s}
$$

Integrating from $a$ to $b$, we have:  

$$
W = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{4 \pi} \ln \left( \frac{b}{a} \right)
$$

By the way, this suggests a very simple way to calculate the self-inductance of the cable. According to Eq. 7.30, the energy can also be written as  

$$
\frac{1}{2} L I^2
$$

Comparing the two expressions,  

$$
L = \frac{\mu_0 l}{2 \pi} \ln \left( \frac{b}{a} \right)
$$

This method of calculating self-inductance is especially useful when the current is not confined to a single path but spreads over some surface or volume so that different parts of the current enclose different amounts of flux. 

In such cases, it can be very tricky to get the inductance directly from Eq. 7.26, and it is best to let Eq. 7.30 define $L$.

如果電流不是流經一個明確的導線，而是散布在一個體積或表面，磁通的概念會變得很模糊

這時候似乎並沒有一個明確的迴路，讓磁通去通過，使用磁能公式計算磁通會比較方便

在DKCheng中，計算同軸電纜的電感，就是計算單位長度，縱向截面內外導體間的磁通

這就是非常tricky的手法

但是，Griffiths在本例中，少算了一個東西，就是內電感

內電感就是電流散布在一個體積中的情況，這時必須引入分數紮的概念，這非常tricky

可以透過磁能去計算內電感嗎，以下進行嘗試

如果在低頻或直流，內部導體的電流會流經整個導線，使得導線內部也有磁場，這部分也會貢獻電感

$$
\oint_C \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I
$$

$$
B\cdot 2\pi s = \mu_0 \frac{\pi s^2}{\pi a^2} I
$$

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi a^2}s
$$

$$
\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi a^2}s \, \hat{\phi}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2 \mu_0} \left( \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi a^2}s \right)^2 = \frac{\mu_0 I^2s^2}{8 \pi^2a^4}
$$

$$
\frac{\mu_0 I^2s^2}{8 \pi^2a^4} \cdot 2 \pi l s \, ds = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{4 \pi a^4} s^3 ds
$$

$$
\frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{4 \pi a^4} \int_{0}^{a} s^3 ds = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{4 \pi a^4} \left[ \frac{s^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{a}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2}LI^2= \frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{4 \pi a^4} \frac{a^4}{4} = \frac{\mu_0 I^2 l}{16\pi}
$$

$$
L= \frac{\mu_0 l}{8\pi}
$$

確實，透過分數紮，單位長度的內電感，算出來的也是 $\mu_0/8\pi$
