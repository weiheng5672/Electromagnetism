### The Divergence of $\hat{r} / r^2$

Consider the vector function  

$$
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

At every location, $\mathbf{v}$ is directed radially outward (Fig. 1.44); if ever there was a function that ought to have a large positive divergence, this is it. 

And yet, when you actually calculate the divergence (using Eq. 1.71), you get precisely zero:  

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (1) = 0
$$

(You will have encountered this paradox already if you worked Prob. 1.16.) 

The plot thickens when we apply the divergence theorem to this function. 

Suppose we integrate over a sphere of radius $R$, centered at the origin (Prob. 1.38b); the surface integral is  

$$
\oint \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \left( \frac{1}{R^2} \hat{r} \right) \cdot \left( R^2 \sin \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \, \hat{r} \right)
$$

$$
= \int_0^\pi \sin \theta \, d\theta \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 4\pi
$$

But the volume integral  
$$
\int \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \, d\tau
$$
is zero, if we are really to believe Eq. (1.84). 

Does this mean that the divergence theorem is false? 

What’s going on here?  

The source of the problem is the point $r = 0$, where $\mathbf{v}$ blows up (and where, in Eq. 1.84, we have unwittingly divided by zero). 

It is quite true that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$ everywhere except the origin, but right at the origin, the situation is more complicated. 

Notice that the surface integral (Eq. 1.85) is independent of $R$; if the divergence theorem is right (and it is), we should get  
$$
\int (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}) \, d\tau = 4\pi
$$
for any sphere centered at the origin, no matter how small. 

Evidently, the entire contribution must be coming from the point $r = 0$ ! 

Thus, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}$ has the bizarre property that it vanishes everywhere except at one point, and yet its integral (over any volume containing that point) is $4\pi$. 

No ordinary function behaves like that.  

(On the other hand, a physical example does come to mind: the density (mass per unit volume) of a point particle. 

It’s zero except at the exact location of the particle, and yet its integral is finite—namely, the mass of the particle.)  

What we have stumbled on is a mathematical object known to physicists as the **Dirac delta function**. 

It arises in many branches of theoretical physics. 

Moreover, the specific problem at hand (the divergence of the function $\hat{r} / r^2$) is not just some arcane curiosity—it is, in fact, central to the whole theory of electrodynamics. 

So it is worthwhile to pause here and study the Dirac delta function with some care.
