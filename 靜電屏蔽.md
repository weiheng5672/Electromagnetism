**Induced Charges**

- If you hold a charge \(+q\) near an uncharged conductor, the two will attract one another. 

- The reason for this is that \(q\) will pull negative charges over to the near side and repel positive charges to the far side. 
  - (Another way to think of it is that the charge moves around in such a way as to cancel out the field of \(q\) for points inside the conductor, where the total field must be zero.) 

- Since the negative induced charge is closer to \(q\), there is a net force of attraction. 
  - (In Chapter 3, we shall calculate this force explicitly for the case of a spherical conductor.)  

- When I speak of the field, charge, or potential “inside” a conductor, I mean in the “meat” of the conductor; 
  - if there is some hollow cavity in the conductor, 
  - and within that cavity you put some charge, 
  - then the field in the cavity will not be zero. 

- But in a remarkable way, the cavity and its contents are electrically isolated from the outside world by the surrounding conductor. 

- No external fields penetrate the conductor; they are canceled at the outer surface by the induced charge there. 

- Similarly, the field due to charges within the cavity is canceled, for all exterior points, by the induced charge on the inner surface. 
  - However, the compensating charge left over on the outer surface of the conductor effectively “communicates” the presence of \(q\) to the outside world.

- The total charge induced on the cavity wall is equal and opposite to the charge inside, for if we surround the cavity with a Gaussian surface, all points of which are in the conductor,  

\[
\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = Q_{\text{enc}} = 0
\]

and hence (by Gauss’s law) the net enclosed charge must be zero. But  

\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = q + q_{\text{induced}} = 0
\]

so  

\[
q_{\text{induced}} = -q.
\]

Then, if the conductor as a whole is electrically neutral, there must be a charge \(+q\) on its outer surface.  

- If a cavity surrounded by conducting material is itself empty of charge, then the field within the cavity is zero. 

- For any field line would have to begin and end on the cavity wall, going from a plus charge to a minus charge. 

- Letting that field line be part of a closed loop, the rest of which is entirely inside the conductor (where \(\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}\)), the integral  

\[
\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
\]  

is distinctly positive, in violation of 

\[
\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0
\]

- It follows that \(\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}\) within an empty cavity, 
  - and there is in fact no charge on the surface of the cavity. 
  - (This is why you are relatively safe inside a metal car during a thunderstorm—
  - you may get cooked, if lightning strikes, but you will not be electrocuted. 
  - The same principle applies to the placement of sensitive apparatus inside a grounded Faraday cage, to shield out stray electric fields. 
  - In practice, the enclosure doesn’t even have to be solid conductor—chicken wire will often suffice.)

- 這部分探討的是導體內如果有空腔，空腔內又有電荷，會怎麼樣?
- 結論就是靜電屏蔽
- 空腔會屏蔽外部的**電磁現象**，導體的外表面會進行屏蔽的機制
- 至於空腔內部的電荷，導體無法完全向外屏蔽
  - 導體能夠屏蔽的是靜電荷在空腔內部的分布信息
  - 但淨電荷量無法對外屏蔽，外部能感受到導體空腔內的靜電荷
- 如果空腔內沒電荷，內部就不會有電場
  - 假設導體內部有電場。
    - 由於空腔內沒有電荷，電場就只能是源自空腔表面的正電荷，止於空腔表面的負電荷
    - 也就是說，假設導體內部有電場，就能推導出，空腔表面必須帶電
  - 構建一個封閉迴路，部分在空腔、部分在導體內部。
  - 電場對該封閉迴路的積分將不為零，這與靜電學的基本性質衝突。
  - 所以假設錯誤，藉由反證法，可以得出，導體內部沒有電場。
  - 導體空腔可以屏蔽外部的靜電場，這就是所謂的法拉第籠
  - 不需要是整片的導體全部屏蔽，導體網也能成立

# 延伸至非靜電

- 屏蔽現象也是在靜電學脈絡中推導的，故稱為靜電屏蔽
- 但這個"靜"，也是可以延伸至準靜態，而這個"準"的範圍並不小
- 甚至在微波頻段，只要場變化不是極其劇烈，所謂的靜電屏蔽依然成立
