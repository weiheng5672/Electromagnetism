### Propagation in Linear Media

Inside matter, but in regions where there is no free charge or free current, Maxwell’s equations become  

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\text{(i)} \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = 0 \\
    &\text{(ii)} \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \\
    &\text{(iii)} \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
    &\text{(iv)} \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}
\end{aligned} \tag{9.65}
$$

If the medium is linear,

$$
\mathbf{D} = \epsilon \mathbf{E}
$$

$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\mu} \mathbf{B} \tag{9.66}
$$

and homogeneous (so $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ do not vary from point to point), they reduce to  

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\text{(i)} \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0 \\
    &\text{(ii)} \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \\
    &\text{(iii)} \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
    &\text{(iv)} \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu \epsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\end{aligned} \tag{9.67}
$$

which differ from the vacuum analogs (Eqs. 9.40) only in the replacement of $\mu_0 \epsilon_0$ by $\mu \epsilon$.  

This observation is mathematically pretty trivial, but the physical implications are astonishing: As the wave passes through, the fields busily polarize and magnetize all the molecules, and the resulting (oscillating) dipoles create their own electric and magnetic fields. 

These combine with the original fields in such a way as to create a single wave with the same frequency but a different speed. 

This extraordinary conspiracy (known in optics as the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem) is responsible for the phenomenon of transparency. 

It is a distinctly nontrivial consequence of linearity. 

For further discussion see:
- M. B. James and D. J. Griffiths, *Am. J. Phys.* **60**, 309 (1992);
- H. Fearn, D. F. V. James, and P. W. Milonni, *Am. J. Phys.* **64**, 986 (1996);

Evidently, electromagnetic waves propagate through a linear homogeneous medium at a speed  

$$
v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon \mu}} = \frac{c}{n} \tag{9.68}
$$

where  

$$
n \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon \mu}{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \tag{9.69}
$$

is the index of refraction of the substance. 

For most materials, $\mu$ is very close to $\mu_0$, so  

$$
n \approx \sqrt{\epsilon_r} \tag{9.70}
$$

where $\epsilon_r$ is the dielectric constant (Eq. 4.34). 

Since $\epsilon_r$ is almost always greater than 1, light travels more slowly through matter—a fact that is well known from optics.  

All of our previous results carry over, with the simple transcription $\epsilon_0 \to \epsilon$, $\mu_0 \to \mu$, and hence $c \to v$. 

The energy density is  

$$
u = \frac{1}{2} \left( \epsilon E^2 + \frac{1}{\mu} B^2 \right) \tag{9.71}
$$

and the Poynting vector is  

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu} (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}) \tag{9.72}
$$


For monochromatic plane waves, the frequency and wave number are related by $\omega = k v$ (Eq. 9.11), the amplitude of $\mathbf{B}$ is $1/v$ times the amplitude of $\mathbf{E}$ (Eq. 9.47), and the intensity is  

$$
I = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon v E_0^2 \tag{9.73}
$$

The interesting question is this: What happens when a wave passes from one transparent medium into another—air to water, say, or glass to plastic? 

As in the case of waves on a string, we expect to get a reflected wave and a transmitted wave. 

The details depend on the exact nature of the electrodynamic boundary conditions, which we derived in Chapter 7 (Eq. 7.65):  

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\text{(i)} \quad \epsilon_1 E_{\perp 1} = \epsilon_2 E_{\perp 2} \\
    &\text{(ii)} \quad B_{\perp 1} = B_{\perp 2} \\
    &\text{(iii)} \quad E_{\parallel 1} = E_{\parallel 2} \\
    &\text{(iv)} \quad \frac{1}{\mu_1} B_{\parallel 1} = \frac{1}{\mu_2} B_{\parallel 2}
\end{aligned} \tag{9.74}
$$

These equations relate the electric and magnetic fields just to the left and just to the right of the interface between two linear media. 

In the following sections, we use them to deduce the laws governing reflection and refraction of electromagnetic waves.  

The dielectric constant is “constant” in the sense of being independent of the amplitude of $\mathbf{E}$, but it may well depend on the frequency, as we shall see. 

Thus, for example, if you quote the (static) dielectric constant for water from Table 4.2, you will conclude that the index of refraction is 8.9, which is wildly off, for visible light ($n = 1.33$).  

See Prob. 8.23; refer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the precise meaning of “energy density” in the context of linear media.  

The momentum carried by an electromagnetic wave in matter is controversial. See, for example,
