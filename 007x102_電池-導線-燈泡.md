歐姆定律是最為人所熟悉的定律之一。

電池-導線-燈泡，這個圖像或許也是人們第一個遇到的電路。

他非常的簡單，或許會讓人困惑這麼簡單的電路竟會有這麼多看似吹毛求疵的問題。

過去通常以水流類比來簡化這些問題。

正如我在電路學的意見，儘管在物理底層原理上，水流類比是完全不精準的，但仍有不可取代的價值。

只是在這裡，我們要進一步超越水流類比，從電磁學的觀點重新塑造對電路的理解。

問題：

第一，驅動力只在電池裡，在電池外部，是什麼機制在推動電荷？

第二，這種機制又是如何運作的，使得電流在整個迴路都一樣？

第三，電荷實際上漂移速度極其緩慢，信息和能量是如何瞬間傳遞的，從電池到燈泡。

第四，一開始形成迴路，是什麼機制讓整個迴路的電子同時開始移動的？

答案：

第一，靜電力。這個答案或許，會讓人有點不太舒服，至少我當初就是這樣，畢竟這邊明明沒有任何靜電荷的樣子，哪來的靜電場?但實際上有，靜電荷位於導線表面，包括電池和導線之間的邊界上。他們會共同形成一個複雜的靜電場，推動導線內的電子。

第二，這個靜電場具有自我校正機制，能確保電流在整個迴路中保持相等。甚至在高頻（無線電波頻段），電流仍能在迴路中處處相等。

第三，正是這種能瞬間讓電流均衡的自我校正機制，使得信息的傳遞速度遠快於電子漂移速度。實際上，這種信號的傳播速度接近光速，但在直流電路中，我們可以近似視為瞬時傳遞。

第四，也正是那種瞬間讓電流處處相等的自我校正機制，使得整個迴路的電子同時開始移動的。

但正如之前所說，僅靠保守的靜電場無法維持電流，必須有非保守場產生的電動勢介入。

這個簡單的迴路中，有兩種推動電荷的機制，靜電場的部分正如上述，它在電池外部主導作用。

電池內部也有靜電場，畢竟在電池與導線交界處積累的電荷，不僅影響外部，也在內部產生靜電場。

在電池內部，存在的非保守機制，路經相關的機制，對抗靜電場，提升電荷的能量(電位能)。

不要把電動勢理解成非保守場做功，這隱含推動電荷的想像。但電動勢同電場、電位差，無關於測試電荷的存在，即使測試電荷不存在，電動勢依然存在。

之後會有範例，清晰說明這一點，就是運動電動勢。運動電動勢中推動電荷的機制是磁力，但磁力不做功，這時就無法把電動勢的定義理解成非保守力作功。

電動勢描述的是能夠維持電流的機制，但若單純定義為『推動電荷的機制』，則會包含靜電場，這顯然不夠精確。

因此更嚴謹的方式是將電動勢定義為：對『電場（任何推動電荷的效應）』沿封閉迴路積分。這種定義下自然排除了靜電場。

電動勢這個詞在英文，還留有一些歷史共業，Electromotive Force，但他不代表力。電動勢也不該被理解為做功。

值得慶幸的是，至少這個詞，在中文有被良好的意譯，這也是我不用「勢」，而是用「位」，去翻譯「potential」，我希望「勢」這個字就保留給電動勢使用。

### Electromotive Force

- If you think about a typical electric circuit—a battery hooked up to a light bulb, say (Fig. 7.7)—a perplexing question arises: 
- In practice, the current is the same all the way around the loop; why is this the case, when the only obvious driving force is inside the battery? 
- Offhand, you might expect a large current in the battery and none at all in the lamp. 
- Who’s doing the pushing in the rest of the circuit, 
- and how does it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each segment? 
- What’s more, given that the charges in a typical wire move (literally) at a snail’s pace (see Prob. 5.20), why doesn’t it take half an hour for the current to reach the light bulb? 
- How do all the charges know to start moving at the same instant?  

**Answer:** 
- If the current were not the same all the way around (for instance, during the first split second after the switch is closed), 
- then charge would be piling up somewhere, and—here’s the crucial point—
  - the electric field of this accumulating charge is in such a direction as to even out the flow. 
- Suppose, for instance, that the current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. 
- Then charge piles up at the “knee,” and this produces a field aiming away from the kink. 
- This field opposes the current flowing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current flowing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is no further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established.  

- It’s a beautiful system, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it all so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all around the circuit, even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies.  

- There are really two forces involved in driving current around a circuit: the source force, $f_s$, which is ordinarily confined to one portion of the loop (a battery, say), and an electrostatic force, which serves to smooth out the flow and communicate the influence of the source to distant parts of the circuit:  
$$
\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{f_s} + \mathbf{E} \tag{7.8}
$$

- The physical agency responsible for $f_s$ can be many different things: in a battery it’s a chemical force; in a piezoelectric crystal, mechanical pressure is converted into an electrical impulse; in a thermocouple, it’s a temperature gradient that does the job; in a photoelectric cell, it’s light; and in a Van de Graaff generator, the electrons are literally loaded onto a conveyor belt and swept along.  

- Whatever the mechanism, its net effect is determined by the line integral of $f$ around the circuit:
$$
\mathcal{E} \equiv \oint \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \oint \mathbf{f_s} \cdot d\mathbf{l} \tag{7.9}
$$


- (Because $\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = 0$ for electrostatic fields, it doesn’t matter whether you use $f$ or $f_s$.)  

- $\mathcal{E}$ is called the electromotive force, or **emf**, of the circuit. 
- It’s a lousy term since this is not a force at all—it’s the integral of a force per unit charge. 
- Some people prefer the word **electromotance**, but **emf** is so established that I think we’d better stick with it.  

- Within an ideal source of emf (a resistanceless battery, for instance), the net force on the charges is zero (Eq. 7.1 with $\sigma = \infty$), so  
$$
\mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{f_s}
$$

- The potential difference between the terminals (a and b) is therefore  
$$
V = -\int_a^b \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} 
$$

$$
= \int_a^b \mathbf{f_s} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \oint \mathbf{f_s} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mathcal{E} \tag{7.10}
$$

- (We can extend the integral to the entire loop because $f_s$ = 0 outside the source.)  

- The function of a battery, then, is to establish and maintain a voltage difference equal to the electromotive force (a 6 V battery, for example, holds the positive terminal 6 V above the negative terminal). 
- The resulting electrostatic field drives current around the rest of the circuit (notice, however, that inside the battery $f_s$ drives current in the direction opposite to $\mathcal{E}$).  

- Because it’s the line integral of $f_s$, $\mathcal{E}$ can be interpreted as the work done per unit charge by the source—indeed, in some books, electromotive force is defined this way. 
- However, as you’ll see in the next section, there is some subtlety involved in this interpretation, so I prefer Eq. 7.9.  

footnote:
- Real batteries have a certain internal resistance, $r$, and the potential difference between their terminals is  
$$
\mathcal{E} - I\,r
$$
when a current $I$ is flowing.  

- For an illuminating discussion of how batteries work, see D. Roberts, *Am. J. Phys.* 51, 829 (1983).
- Current in an electric circuit is somewhat analogous to the flow of water in a closed system of pipes, with gravity playing the role of the electrostatic field, and a pump (lifting the water up against gravity) in the role of the battery. In this story, height is analogous to voltage.
