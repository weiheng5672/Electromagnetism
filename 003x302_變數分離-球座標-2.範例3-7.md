Example 3.7. The potential V 0 (θ) is again speciﬁed on the surface of a sphere of
radius R, but this time we are asked to ﬁnd the potential outside, assuming there
is no charge there.
Solution
In this case it’s the A l ’s that must be zero (or else V would not go to zero at ∞ ), so
V ( r , θ) =
∞ 
l = 0
B l
r l + 1
P l ( cos θ). (3.72)
At the surface of the sphere, we require that
V ( R , θ) =
∞ 
l = 0
B l
R l + 1
P l ( cos θ) = V 0 (θ).
Multiplying by P l
 ( cos θ) sin θ and integrating—exploiting, again, the orthogo-
nality relation 3.68—we have
B l

R l
 + 1
2
2l
 + 1
=
 π
0
V 0 (θ) P l
 ( cos θ) sin θ d θ,
or
B l =
2l + 1
2
R
l + 1
 π
0
V 0 (θ) P l ( cos θ) sin θ d θ. (3.73)
Equation 3.72, with the coefﬁcients given by Eq. 3.73, is the solution to our
problem.
