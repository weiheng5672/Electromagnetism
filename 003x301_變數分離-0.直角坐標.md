- In this section, we shall attack Laplace’s equation 
  - directly using the method of separation of variables, 
  - which is the physicist’s favorite tool 
  - for solving partial differential equations. 

- The method is applicable in circumstances 
  - where the potential $V$ or the charge density $\sigma$ 
  - is specified on the boundaries of some region, 
  - and we are asked to find the potential in the interior.  

- The basic strategy is very simple: 
  - we look for solutions that are products of functions, 
  - each of which depends on only one of the coordinates.

- The algebraic details, however, can be formidable, 
- so I’m going to develop the method through a sequence of examples. 

- We’ll start with Cartesian coordinates and then move on to spherical coordinates 
- (I’ll leave the cylindrical case for you to tackle on your own, in Problem 3.24).

- **formidable**：表示某事物「令人畏懼的、艱鉅的、難以克服的」。在這裡，指「代數細節可能會很複雜或困難」。  
- **tackle**：在這裡指「應對、處理、解決」。意思是「我要介紹直角坐標和球坐標的例子，而柱坐標的情況就留給你自己解決」。
