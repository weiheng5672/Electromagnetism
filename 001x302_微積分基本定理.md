# The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Suppose $f(x)$ is a function of one variable. 

The fundamental theorem of calculus says:

$$
\int_a^b \frac{df}{dx} \, dx = f(b) - f(a) \tag{1.54}
$$

In case this doesn’t look familiar, I’ll write it another way:

$$
\int_a^b F(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a)
$$

where $\frac{df}{dx} = F(x)$. 

The fundamental theorem tells you how to integrate $F(x)$: you think up a function $f(x)$ whose derivative is equal to $F$.

**Geometrical Interpretation:** According to Eq. 1.33, $df = \left( \frac{df}{dx} \right) dx$ is the infinitesimal change in $f$ when you go from $x$ to $x + dx$. The fundamental theorem (Eq. 1.54) says that if you chop the interval from $a$ to $b$ (Fig. 1.25) into many tiny pieces $dx$, and add up the increments $df$ from each little piece, the result is (not surprisingly) equal to the total change in $f$: $f(b) - f(a)$. 

In other words, there are two ways to determine the total change in the function: either subtract the values at the ends or go step-by-step, adding up all the tiny increments as you go. You’ll get the same answer either way.

Notice the basic format of the fundamental theorem: the integral of a derivative over some region is given by the value of the function at the endpoints (boundaries). In vector calculus there are three species of derivative (gradient, divergence, and curl), and each has its own “fundamental theorem,” with essentially the same format. I don’t plan to prove these theorems here; rather, I will explain what they mean, and try to make them plausible. Proofs are given in Appendix A.

### 向量微積分基本脈絡（核心觀念）

> **對一個導函數（不論是一維導數、梯度、散度或旋度）在某個區域上做積分，其結果由原函數在邊界上的值所決定。**

這是一個貫穿整個向量微積分的主軸。其單變數的形式即是：

$$
\int_a^b \frac{df}{dx} \, dx = f(b) - f(a)
$$

這套架構的美妙之處在於，它讓「區域內部的微分性質」與「邊界上的整體變化」之間建立起深刻連結。 

而作者說的留到附錄證明，是因為一旦要處理任意的正交座標系統（例如球坐標、柱座標），證明就會涉及更多計算細節，反而會干擾直觀的認識。
