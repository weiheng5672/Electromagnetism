**Example 4.8.** 

- Suppose the entire region below the plane $z = 0$ is filled with uniform linear dielectric material of susceptibility $\chi_e$. 
- Calculate the force on a point charge $q$ situated a distance $d$ above the origin.

**Solution**  

- The surface bound charge on the $xy$-plane is of opposite sign to $q$, 
- so the force will be attractive. 
- (In view of 
$$
\rho_b = -\nabla \cdot P
$$
$$
= -\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon_0 \frac{\chi_e}{\varepsilon} D) = -\frac{\chi_e}{1 + \chi_e} \rho_f
$$
there is no volume bound charge.) 

- Let us first calculate $\sigma_b$, using 
$$
\sigma_b \equiv \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n},
$$
- and 
$$
\vec{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E}
$$

$$
\sigma_b = \vec{P} \cdot \hat{n} = P_z = \epsilon_0 \chi_e E_z,
$$

- where $E_z$ is the $z$-component of the total field just inside the dielectric, at $z = 0$. 
- This field is due in part to $q$ and in part to the bound charge itself. 
- From Coulomb’s law, the former contribution is  
$$
-\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(r^2 + d^2)} \cos\theta = -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q d}{(r^2 + d^2)^{3/2}},
$$

- where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is the distance from the origin. 
- The $z$-component of the field of the bound charge, meanwhile, is $-\sigma_b / 2\epsilon_0$ (by Guass`law). 
- Thus,  
$$
\sigma_b = \epsilon_0 \chi_e \left( -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q d}{(r^2 + d^2)^{3/2}} - \frac{\sigma_b}{2\epsilon_0} \right).
$$

- Solving for $\sigma_b$,  
$$
\sigma_b = -\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\chi_e}{\chi_e + 2} \frac{q d}{(r^2 + d^2)^{3/2}}
$$

- Apart from the factor $\chi_e / (\chi_e + 2)$, this is exactly the same as the induced charge on an infinite conducting plane under similar circumstances
$$
\sigma_b = \frac{- q d}{2\pi(x^2 + y^2 + d^2)^{3/2}}
$$
>For some purposes, a conductor can be regarded as the limiting case of a linear dielectric, with $\chi_e \to \infty$. This is often a useful check—try applying it to Exs. 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7.

- Evidently, the total bound charge is  
$$
q_b = -\frac{\chi_e}{\chi_e + 2} q.
$$

- We could, of course, obtain the field of $\sigma_b$ by direct integration:  
$$
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2} \sigma_b \, da.
$$

- But, as in the case of the conducting plane, there is a nicer solution by the method of images. 
- Indeed, if we replace the dielectric by a single point charge $q_b$ at the image position $(0,0,-d)$, we have  
$$
V_上 = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - d)^2}}
$$
$$
+\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_b}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z + d)^2}} 
$$
in the region $z > 0$.

- Meanwhile, a charge $(q + q_b)$ at $(0,0,d)$ yields the potential  
$$
V_下 = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q + q_b}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - d)^2}}
$$ 
for the region $z < 0$. 

- Taken together, $V_上$ and $V_下$ constitute a function that satisfies Poisson’s equation with a point charge $q$ at $(0,0,d)$, 
  - which goes to zero at infinity, 
  - which is continuous at the boundary $z = 0$, 
  - and whose normal derivative exhibits the discontinuity appropriate to a surface charge $\sigma_b$ at $z = 0$:  
$$
-\epsilon_0 \left( \left. \frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \right|_{z=0^+} - \left. \frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \right|_{z=0^-} \right)
$$

$$
= -\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\chi_e}{\chi_e + 2} \frac{q d}{(x^2 + y^2 + d^2)^{3/2}}
$$

- Accordingly, this is the correct potential for our problem. 
- In particular, the force on $q$ is:  
$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q q_b}{(2d)^2} \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

$$
= -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\chi_e}{\chi_e + 2} \frac{q^2}{4d^2} \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

- I do not claim to have provided a compelling motivation for $V_上$ and $V_下$—like all image solutions, this one owes its justification to the fact that it works: it solves Poisson’s equation, and it meets the boundary conditions. 
- Still, discovering an image solution is not entirely a matter of guesswork. 
- There are at least two “rules of the game”:  

1. You must never put an image charge into the region where you’re computing the potential. (Thus $V_上$ gives the potential for $z > 0$, but this image charge $q_b$ is at $z = -d$; when we turn to the region $z < 0$ $(V_下)$, the image charge $(q + q_b)$ is at $z = +d$.)

2. The image charges must add up to the correct total in each region. (That’s how I knew to use $q_b$ to account for the charge in the region $z \leq 0$, and $(q + q_b)$ to cover the region $z \geq 0$.)

- 電荷和介電質放在一起，他們之間會有力的作用。
- 電荷產生的電場會在介電質表面感應出異性的束縛電荷，他們之間會有吸引力。
