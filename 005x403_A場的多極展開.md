任何有限的物體，無論其形狀多麼複雜，只要觀察點足夠遠，都可以近似為一個點。這正是多極展開的核心思想。  

在這個脈絡下，通常使用球座標系中的勒讓德多項式展開來處理問題。詳細的推導過程已經在電荷分佈的多極展開中介紹過，對於穩態電流迴路，可以直接套用相同的數學結果。  

不同之處在於，向量勢 $\mathbf{A}$ 的多極展開中，第一項（對應於「單極項」）恆為零，這反映了磁單極在自然界中並不存在。  

因此，最重要的貢獻來自於第二項，稱為 **磁偶極項**。  

磁偶極矩 $\mathbf{m}$ 是一個向量，其大小等於電流 $I$ 乘以迴路面積 $a$，方向則由右手定則確定（右手指向電流環繞的方向，拇指指向磁偶極矩的方向）。  

理想的磁偶極子可以視為一個點，其內部包含一個無限小的電流迴路，電流為 $I$，迴路面積為 $d\mathbf{a}$。

### Multipole Expansion of the Vector Potential  

- If you want an approximate formula for the vector potential of a localized current distribution, valid at distant points, a multipole expansion is in order. 
- Remember: the idea of a multipole expansion is to write the potential in the form of a power series in $1 / r$, where $r$ is the distance to the point in question (Fig. 5.51); if $r$ is sufficiently large, the series will be dominated by the lowest nonvanishing contribution, and the higher terms can be ignored. 
- As we found in Sect. 3.4.1 (Eq. 3.94),  
$$
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{r'}{r} \right)^n P_n (\cos \alpha)
$$

- where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r'}$. Accordingly, the vector potential of a current loop can be written as  
$$
\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \oint \frac{d\mathbf{l'}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|}
$$

$$
= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{r^{n+1}} \oint (r')^n P_n (\cos \alpha) d\mathbf{l'}
$$

- Or, more explicitly:

$$
\mathbf{A} (\mathbf{r}) =\frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \left[ \frac{1}{r} \oint d\mathbf{l'}\right]
$$

$$
+\frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \left[\frac{1}{r^2} \oint r' \cos \alpha \, d\mathbf{l'}\right]
$$

$$
+\frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi} \left[\frac{1}{r^3} \oint (r')^2 \left( \frac{3}{2} \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{1}{2} \right) d\mathbf{l'}+ \dots \right]
$$

- As in the multipole expansion of $V$, we call the first term (which goes like $1/r$) the **monopole term**, the second (which goes like $1/r^2$) the **dipole term**, the third the **quadrupole term**, and so on.  

- Now, the **magnetic monopole term** is always zero, because the integral is just the total vector displacement around a closed loop:  
$$
\oint d\mathbf{l'} = 0
$$

- This reflects the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles in nature—an assumption contained in Maxwell’s equation $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$, on which the entire theory of vector potential is predicated.  

- In the absence of any monopole contribution, the dominant term is the dipole term (except in the rare case where it, too, vanishes):  
$$
\mathbf{A}_{\text{dip}} (\mathbf{r}) =
\frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi r^2} \oint (r' \cos \alpha) d\mathbf{l'}
$$

$$
= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi r^2} \oint (\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r'}) d\mathbf{l'}
$$

- This integral can be rewritten in a more illuminating way if we invoke Eq. 1.108, with $\mathbf{c} = \hat{\mathbf{r}}$:  
$$
\oint (\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{r'}) d\mathbf{l'} = - \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \int d\mathbf{a'}
$$

- Thus
$$
\mathbf{A}_{\text{dip}} (\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathbf{m} \times \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}  \tag{5.85}
$$

- where $\mathbf{m}$ is the **magnetic dipole moment**:  
$$
\mathbf{m} \equiv I \int d\mathbf{a} = I \mathbf{a} \tag{5.86}
$$

- Here, $\mathbf{a}$ is the **vector area** of the loop (see Problem 1.62). 
- If the loop is flat, $\mathbf{a}$ is simply the ordinary area enclosed, with its direction assigned by the usual **right-hand rule** (fingers in the direction of the current).

---

- It is clear from Eq. 5.86 that the magnetic dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin. 
- You may remember that the electric dipole moment is independent of the origin only when the total charge vanishes (Sect. 3.4.3). 
- Since the magnetic monopole moment is always zero, it is not really surprising that the magnetic dipole moment is always independent of origin.  

- Although the dipole term dominates the multipole expansion (unless $\mathbf{m} = 0$) and thus offers a good approximation to the true potential, it is not ordinarily the exact potential; there will be quadrupole, octopole, and higher-order contributions. 
- You might ask, is it possible to devise a current distribution whose potential is a **pure** dipole—meaning Eq. 5.85 is exact?
- Well, yes and no: like its electrical analog, it can be done, but the model is somewhat contrived. To begin with, you must take an **infinitesimally small loop** at the origin, but then, in order to keep the dipole moment finite, you have to crank the current up to infinity while holding the product $\mathbf{m} = I \mathbf{a}$ fixed.
- In practice, the dipole potential is a suitable approximation whenever the distance $r$ greatly exceeds the size of the loop.
- The magnetic field of a **perfect dipole** is easiest to calculate if we place $\mathbf{m}$ at the origin and align it along the $z$-direction (Fig. 5.54). 
- According to Eq. 5.85, the vector potential at point $(r, \theta, \phi)$ is  
$$
\mathbf{A}_{\text{dip}} (\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{m \sin \theta}{r^2} \hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}} \tag{5.87}
$$

- and hence  
$$
\mathbf{B}_{\text{dip}} (\mathbf{r}) = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}
$$

$$
= \frac{\mu_0 m}{4 \pi r^3} (2 \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin \theta \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}) \tag{5.88}
$$

- Surprisingly, this has the **same mathematical structure** as the field of an electric dipole (Eq. 3.103)! 
- However, up close, the field of a physical **magnetic dipole**—a small current loop—looks quite different from the field of a physical **electric dipole**—a pair of opposite charges separated by a small distance. Compare Fig. 5.55 with Fig. 3.37.
