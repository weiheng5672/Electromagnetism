### Where is the energy stored? 

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho V \, d\tau \quad (1)
\]

and 

\[
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int_{all \, space} E^2 \, d\tau  \quad (2)
\]

offer two different ways of calculating the same thing. 

- The first is an integral over the charge distribution; 
- the second is an integral over the field. 

These can involve completely different regions. 

For instance, in the case of the spherical shell, the charge is confined to the surface, whereas the electric field is everywhere outside this surface.

- Where is the energy, then? 
  + Is it stored in the field, as Eq.(2) seems to suggest, 
  + or is it stored in the charge, as Eq.(1) implies?  

- At the present stage, this is simply an unanswerable question: 
  + I can tell you what the total energy is, 
  + and I can provide you with several different ways to compute it, 
  + but it is impertinent to worry about where the energy is located. 

In the context of radiation theory, it is useful (and in general relativity, it is essential) to regard the energy as stored in the field, with a density  

\[
\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} E^2 \quad \text{(energy per unit volume)}
\]

But in electrostatics, one could just as well say it is stored in the charge, with a density  

\[
\frac{1}{2} \rho V
\]

The difference is purely a matter of bookkeeping.

- 無論我們選擇哪種方式來描述能量（是存在於場中還是存在於電荷中），最終的總能量都是相同的。
- 在輻射的情境下，將能量視為儲存在場中較為有用；而在廣義相對論的框架下，能量本質上確實是存於場中。
- 但在靜電學中，說能量儲存在電荷內同樣是合理的。
- 這種區別純粹是計算方式的不同，正如無論你把錢存在哪個帳戶，總金額始終不變。
