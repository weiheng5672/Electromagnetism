# 問題：

- An uncharged spherical conductor centered at the origin has a cavity of some weird shape carved out of it. 
- Somewhere within the cavity is a charge q. 
- Question: What is the ﬁeld outside the sphere?

# 我的解答：

- 這是個靜電屏蔽的問題，原文有圖，但這裡不重複
- 圖的目的是為了讓人直觀理解，但該有的信息全在題目中了
  - 導體球
  - 未帶電
  - 球心位於原點
  - 內部有奇怪形狀的空腔
  - 空腔內有電荷$ q $
- 依據靜電感應的相關知識
  - 導體球空腔內的電荷分布會向外屏蔽，但淨電荷量不會
  - 導體球心位於原點
  - 所以對於外部來說，這就是個帶有淨電荷$ q $，球心位於原點的導體球
  - 所以導體外的電場分布自然就是
  
$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}
$$

### Solution

- At first glance, it would appear that the answer depends on the shape of the cavity and the location of the charge. 

- But that’s wrong: the answer is  

$$
E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

regardless. 

- The conductor conceals from us all information concerning the nature of the cavity, revealing only the total charge it contains. 

- How can this be?  

- Well, the charge $ +q $ induces an opposite charge $ -q $ on the wall of the cavity, which distributes itself in such a way that its field cancels that of $ q $, for all points exterior to the cavity. 

- Since the conductor carries no net charge, this leaves $ +q $ to distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere. 
  - (It’s uniform because the asymmetrical influence of the point charge $ +q $ is negated by that of the induced charge $ -q $ on the inner surface.) 

- For points outside the sphere, then, the only thing that survives is the field of the leftover $ +q $, uniformly distributed over the outer surface.  

- It may occur to you that in one respect this argument is open to challenge: 
  - There are actually three fields at work here: $ E_q $, $ E_{\text{induced}} $, and $ E_{\text{leftover}} $. 
  - All we know for certain is that the sum of the three is zero inside the conductor, 
  - yet I claimed that the first two alone cancel, while the third is separately zero there. 
  - Moreover, even if the first two cancel within the conductor, who is to say they still cancel for points outside? 
  - They do not, after all, cancel for points inside the cavity.  

- I cannot give you a completely satisfactory answer at the moment, but this much at least is true: 
  - There exists a way of distributing $ -q $ over the inner surface so as to cancel the field of $ q $ at all exterior points. 
  - For that same cavity could have been carved out of a huge spherical conductor with a radius of 27 miles or light-years or whatever. 
  - In that case, the leftover $ +q $ on the outer surface is simply too far away to produce a significant field, 
  - and the other two fields would have to accomplish the cancellation by themselves. 
  - So we know they can do it... but are we sure they choose to? 
  - Perhaps for small spheres nature prefers some complicated three-way cancellation.  

- Nope: As we’ll see in the uniqueness theorems of Chapter 3, 
  - electrostatics is very stingy with its options; 
  - there is always precisely one way—no more—of distributing the charge on a conductor so as to make the field inside zero. 
  - Having found a possible way, we are guaranteed that no alternative exists, even in principle.

# 比較

- 作者除了解答這個簡單的問題以外，還問了一個意義深遠的問題
- 有沒有可能存在其他分布，仍然滿足條件?
  - 是的，我們這個分布是對的，但她是唯一的嗎?
- 確實是唯一的，但這需要借助靜電學解的唯一定理。
- 在這個階段，這確實是無法回答的問題。

# 心得

- 電磁學的學習，是一種從特例到一般性的過程
  - 這種過程，其實是不符合邏輯的，就像解這個習題一樣。

- 但是這很重要，這種學習方式可以讓我們快速理解既有知識
  - 當遇到邊界時，我們要有意識地察覺到這些限制。
  
- 另外作者沒提到的一個小細節就是，導體球的球心在原點，也是個關鍵條件
  - 如果導體球的球心不在原點，解的形式也不會那麼簡單。
