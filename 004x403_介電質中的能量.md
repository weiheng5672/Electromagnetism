- 以下原文我還沒仔細確認(算出每一個積分)，但大致上，作者想表達的就是，當介電質存在的場合，靜電能的公式，儘管推廣上看上去非常自然，但仍然有魔鬼在細節中。
$$
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int E^2 \, d\tau
$$

推廣成
$$
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int \varepsilon_r E^2 \, d\tau = \frac{1}{2} \int D \cdot E \, d\tau
$$

- 有沒有想過為何不是兩個E都換成D，而是只需要換一個?這是合理的質疑和猜測，儘管從結果上來說，公式確實是對的，但他對在哪?光這樣簡單類比，很難解釋這個公式所包含的細節。
- 結論就是推廣的公式，包含了拉扯極化分子的能量，他才是我們要的，在電介質存在的場合，建立一個靜電荷系統所需要做的功，靜電荷系統擁有的總能量。
- 推廣的公式只包括自由電荷，束縛電荷的響應自動包括在D裡。
- 未推廣的公式相當於是把所有的自由電荷和束縛電荷都考慮進去，但沒有包括形成束縛電荷過程所需要的能量。
- 例題4-9，建構一個圖像，可以讓我們比較那種差別。

### Energy in Dielectric Systems  

It takes work to charge up a capacitor (Eq. 2.55):  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} C V^2.
$$

If the capacitor is filled with a linear dielectric, its capacitance exceeds the vacuum value by a factor of the dielectric constant,  

$$
C = \varepsilon_r C_{\text{vac}},
$$

as we found in Example 4.6. Evidently, the work necessary to charge a dielectric-filled capacitor is increased by the same factor. The reason is pretty clear: you have to pump in more (free) charge to achieve a given potential because part of the field is canceled off by the bound charges.  

In Chapter 2, I derived a general formula for the energy stored in any electrostatic system (Eq. 2.45):  

$$
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int E^2 \, d\tau
$$

(4.55)  

The case of the dielectric-filled capacitor suggests that this should be changed to  

$$
W = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \int \varepsilon_r E^2 \, d\tau = \frac{1}{2} \int D \cdot E \, d\tau
$$

in the presence of linear dielectrics. To prove it, suppose the dielectric material is fixed in position, and we bring in the free charge, a bit at a time. As $\rho_f$ is increased by an amount $\delta \rho_f$, the polarization will change, and with it, the bound charge distribution; but we’re interested only in the work done on the incremental free charge:  

$$
\delta W = \int (\delta \rho_f) V \, d\tau.
$$

Since $\nabla \cdot D = \rho_f$, we can write  

$$
\delta \rho_f = \nabla \cdot (\delta D),
$$

where $\delta D$ is the resulting change in $D$, so  

$$
\delta W = \int [\nabla \cdot (\delta D)] V \, d\tau.
$$

Now, using the identity  

$$
\nabla \cdot [( \delta D) V] = [\nabla \cdot (\delta D)] V + \delta D \cdot (\nabla V),
$$

and integrating by parts, we obtain  

$$
\delta W = \int \nabla \cdot [( \delta D) V] \, d\tau + \int (\delta D) \cdot E \, d\tau.
$$

The divergence theorem turns the first term into a surface integral, which vanishes if we integrate over all space. Therefore, the work done is  

$$
\delta W = \int (\delta D) \cdot E \, d\tau.
$$

(4.57)  

So far, this applies to any material. Now, if the medium is a linear dielectric, then  

$$
D = \varepsilon E,
$$

so  

$$
\frac{1}{2} \delta (D \cdot E) = \frac{1}{2} \delta (\varepsilon E^2) = \varepsilon (\delta E) \cdot E = (\delta D) \cdot E
$$

(for infinitesimal increments). Thus,  

$$
\delta W = \delta \left(\frac{1}{2} \int D \cdot E \, d\tau \right).
$$

The total work done, then, as we build the free charge up from zero to the final configuration, is  

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} \int D \cdot E \, d\tau.
$$

(4.58)  

as anticipated.  

It may puzzle you that Eq. 4.55, which we derived quite generally in Chapter 2, does not seem to apply in the presence of dielectrics, where it is replaced by Eq. 4.58. The point is not that one or the other of these equations is wrong, but rather that they address somewhat different questions. The distinction is subtle, so let’s go right back to the beginning: What do we mean by “the energy of a system”?  

Answer: It is the work required to assemble the system. Very well—but when dielectrics are involved, there are two quite different ways one might construe this process:  

1. **We bring in all the charges (free and bound), one by one, with tweezers, and glue each one down in its proper final location.**  
   If this is what you mean by “assemble the system,” then Eq. 4.55 is your formula for the energy stored. Notice, however, that this will not include the work involved in stretching and twisting the dielectric molecules (if we picture the positive and negative charges as held together by tiny springs, it does not include the spring energy, $\frac{1}{2} kx^2$, associated with polarizing each molecule).  

2. **With the unpolarized dielectric in place, we bring in the free charges, one by one, allowing the dielectric to respond as it sees fit.**  
   If this is what you mean by “assemble the system” (and ordinarily it is, since free charge is what we actually push around), then Eq. 4.58 is the formula you want. In this case, the “spring” energy is included, albeit indirectly, because the force you must apply to the free charge depends on the disposition of the bound charge; as you move the free charge, you are automatically stretching those “springs.”
