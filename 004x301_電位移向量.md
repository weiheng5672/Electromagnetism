- In Sect. 4.2 we found that the effect of polarization is to produce accumulations of (bound) charge,  
$$
\rho_b = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}
$$

- within the dielectric and  
$$
\sigma_b = \mathbf{P} \cdot \hat{n}
$$
    on the surface. 

- The field due to polarization of the medium is just the field of this bound charge.
- We are now ready to put it all together: 
  - the field attributable to bound charge 
  - plus the field due to everything else (which, for want of a better term, we call free charge, $\rho_f$). 
- The free charge might consist of electrons on a conductor or ions embedded in the dielectric material or whatever; any charge, 
  - in other words, that is not a result of polarization.  

- Within the dielectric, the total charge density can be written:
$$
\rho = \rho_b + \rho_f
$$

- and Gauss’s law reads
$$
\epsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho = \rho_b + \rho_f = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P} + \rho_f
$$

- where $\mathbf{E}$ is now the total field, not just that portion generated by polarization. 
- It is convenient to combine the two divergence terms:
$$
\nabla \cdot (\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}) = \rho_f
$$

- The expression in parentheses, designated by the letter **D**,
$$
\mathbf{D} \equiv \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}
$$
    is known as the **electric displacement**. 

- In terms of $\mathbf{D}$, Gauss’s law reads
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho_f
$$

- or, in integral form,
$$
\oint \mathbf{D} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = Q_{f,\text{enc}}
$$
  - where $Q_{f,\text{enc}}$ denotes the total free charge enclosed in the volume. 
 
- This is a particularly useful way to express Gauss’s law, in the context of dielectrics, 
- because it makes reference only to free charges, and free charge is the stuff we control. 
- Bound charge comes along for the ride: 
  - when we put the free charge in place, a certain polarization automatically ensues, 
  - by the mechanisms of Sect. 4.1, and this polarization produces the bound charge.  

- In a typical problem, therefore, we know $\rho_f$, but we do not (initially) know $\rho_b$; 
- Eq. (4.23) lets us go right to work with the information at hand. 
- In particular, whenever the requisite symmetry is present, 
  - we can immediately calculate $\mathbf{D}$ by the standard Gauss’s law methods.

### D場的定義
- 當一個區域同時考慮進自由電荷和束縛電荷，這個區域的電場，將是兩者共同造成的。
- 定義一個只和自由電荷相關的場，包含進束縛電荷的效應，
- 這個東西叫做D場，他會是，真空介電常數×電場+極化向量，
- 相當於電場加上一個位移項，所以又稱電位移向量。
- 一般和物質中的靜電場相關的習題，都是在算D場。
- 在這些習題中，給定自由電荷，可以直接求得D場。

### D場的釐清
- 在這個階段，無法從D去求出物質中的E。
- 在例題4.4，透過高斯定律求出D，進一步算出真空中的E。
- 但是，例題4.4無法算出，介電質中的E。

### 例題4.4

A long straight wire, carrying uniform line charge $\lambda$, is surrounded by rubber insulation out to a radius $a$ . 
Find the electric displacement.

解

Drawing a cylindrical Gaussian surface, of radius $s$ and length $L$, and applying
$$
\oint \mathbf{D} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = Q_{f,\text{enc}}
$$

we ﬁnd
$$
D(2\pi s L) = \lambda L
$$

$$
D = D(s) = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi s}
$$

Therefore
$$
\vec{D}(s) = D(s) \, \hat{s} = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi s} \, \hat{s}
$$

Notice that this formula holds both within the insulation and outside it.

In the latter region, $\vec{P}$ = 0, so
$$
\vec{E}(s) = \frac{\vec{D}(s)}{\epsilon_0} =  \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 s} \, \hat{s} \quad \text{for} \quad s > a
$$

Inside the rubber, the electric ﬁeld cannot be determined, since we do not know $\vec{P}$.
